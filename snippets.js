// When a function is invoked with 'new' infront of it
// the following things are done automatically:

// 1 A brand new object is created (aka constructed)
// 2 The newly constructed object is [[Prototype]]-linked
// 3 Tue newly constructed object is set as 'this' binding for that function call
// 4 Unless the fubction returns its own alternate object, the new invoked
// function call will autoatically return the new constructed object


// By calling foo(...) with new infront of it we construct a new
// object and set that new object as this for the call of foo(...)
// we call this 'new binding'

function foo(a) {
  this.a = a;
}

var bar = new foo(2);
console.log(bar.a);


// explicit vs implicit binding
// explicit binding thakes precedence over implicit binding
function foo() {
  console.log(this.a);
}

var obj1 = {
  a: 1,
  foo: foo
};

var obj2 = {
  a: 2,
  foo: foo
};

obj1.foo(); // 1
obj1.foo.call(obj1) // 1

obj2.foo(); // 2
obj2.foo.call(obj2) // 2


// what about the 'new binding' ?

console.log(obj2.a); // 2

// -------------------//

var bar = new obj1.foo(3); // 3
console.log(bar.a); // 3


// The new binding is more precedent than implicit binding.
// But is new binding more  or less precedent than explicit binding?

// 'new' and call/apply cannot be combined, so foo.call(obj1) is not allowed
// but we can still use 'hard binding'.


// Hard binding is a form of explicit binding.
// is it more precedent than the new binding and cannot be overwritten with new?
// Lets try..

function foo(something) {
  this.a = something;
  console.log(something);
}

console.log(obj1.a) // 1
console.log(baz.a); // 3

// bar is now hard-bound against obj1, but the new bar(3) did not change
// obj1.a to 3 asexpected, instead the hard-bound (to obj1) call to bar(...)
// is able to be overridden with new. Since new was applied we got
// the newly created objct back, which is named baz, and bas.a = 3

// this bind-helper below does not have a way for a new operator call to overridde
// the hard-binding to obj as we can see above.
function bind(fn, obj) {
  return function() {
    fn.apply(obj, arguments)
  };
}

// But the built-in function: Function.prototype.bind(...) as of ES5 is more
// sophisticated, here is the slighlt modified polyfill by MDN page for bind(...);

if (!Function.prototype.bind) {
	Function.prototype.bind = function(oThis) {

// The part that allows pverriding is :
// this instanceof fNOP && oThis ? this : oThis
// and
// fNop.prototype = this.prototype;
// fBound.prototype = new fNOP;


// Determining 'this'

// 1. is the function called with 'new-binding', if so
// 'this' is the newly constructed object
// var bar = new foo();


// 2. Is the function called with 'call' or 'apply' (explicit-binding)
// 'this' is the explictly specified object
// var bar = foo.call(obj2);


// 3. Is the function called with 'context' (implicit-binding) otherwise
// known as an owning or containing object? 'this' is 'that' context object
// var bar = obj1.foo()

// 4. otherwise, default the 'this' (default-binding)
// If 'strict mode', pick undefined, otherwise pickup the global object
// var bar = foo();

// Lexical 'this'
// Normal functions abide by the four rules above. But ES6
// introduces a special kind of o ffunction that does not use these rules
// The arrow-function.
// Arrow-functions are signfied not by the function keyword, but  by
// the so called "fat arrow" =>
// instead of using the four standard 'this' rules arrow-functions adopt the
// 'this' binding from the enclosing (function or global) scope.

function foo() {
  // return an arrow functions
  return (a) => {
    console.log(this.a);
  };
}

var obj1 = {
  a: 2
};

var obj2 = {
  a: 3
};

var bar = foo.call(obj1);
bar.call(obj2); // 2 not 3


// The arrow-fuction created in foo() lexically captures whatever foo()s 'this'
// is at all call-time. Since foo() was this-bound  to obj1,
// bar - a reference to the returned arrow-function will also be 'this-bound' to obj1
// The lexical binding of an arrow-fuction cannot be overridden even with 'new'.

// Common use-cases will likely be in the use of callbacks,
// such as event handlers or timers:
function foo() {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(this.a);
  }, 100);
}

var obj = {
  a:2
}

foo.call(obj); // 2



// OBJECTS
// Objects cp,e o 2 forms, the declaratve (literal) form and the constructed form

// Literal syntax for an object:

var someObj = {
  key: value
};

// The constructed form of an object:
var somOtherObj = new Object();
somOtherObj.key = value;

// The constructed form and the literal for result in exactly the same sort of obj
// The difference is you can add one or more key/value pairs to the literal declaration,
// whereas with constructed-form objects you must add the properties one by one.

// Language Types:
// string
// number
// boolean
// null
// undefined
// object


// Built-in objects:
// String
// Number
// Boolean
// Object
// Function
// Array
// Date
// RegExp
// Error

// Each of these built-in functions can be used as a constructor
// (that is  a function call with the new operator) with the result being
// a new constructed object of the subtype. For instance:


var stringPrimitive = "I am a string";
typeof stringPrimitive; // 'string'
stringPrimitive instanceof String; // false

var stringObject = new String("I am a String")
typeof stringObject; // 'object'
stringObject instanceof String // false

// Inspect object sub-type
Object.prototype.toString.call(stringObject) // [object String]


// THe primitive value "I a a string" is not an object, it's a string
// literal and immutable value. to perform operations on it such as
// checking its length, accessnig its individual character contents etc, a string
// object is required. However the language automatically coerces a string
// primitive to a String object when necesary.
// It is strongly oreferred by the majority if the JS-comunty to use literal form
// for a value when possible, rather than the constructed object form.

// Consider:

var stringPrimitive = "i am a string";
console.log(stringPrimitive.length); //13
console.log(stringPrimitive.charAt(3));  //m



// Contents
var someObj = {
  a: 2
};
console.log(someObj["a"]); //2
console.log(someObj.a); // 2

// To access the property 'a' use operator:
// [ ] - "key access"
// or
// . -property access
// In objects property names are always strings
// IF anther value than string is being used it will first be
// converted to a string, this even includes nubers, whch are commonly
// used as array-indexes so be careful not to confuse numbers between
// objects and arrays

var someOtherObj = {};

someOtherObj[true] = "foo";
someOtherObj[3] = "bar";
someOtherObj[someOtherObj] = "baz";


console.log(someOtherObj["true"]); // foo
console.log(someOtherObj[3]); // bar
console.log(someOtherObj["[object Object]"]); // baz


// Computed proerty names
// ES6 adds "computed property names" where you can specify an expression
// surrounded by a "[]" pair, in the key-name position of an object litteral declaration
var prefix = "foo";

var prefixObj = {
  [prefix + "bar"]: "hello",
  [prefix + "baz"]: "world"
};

// not recommended
console.log(prefixObj["foobar"]); // hello
console.log(prefixObj["foobaz"]); // world

var theObject = {
  [Symbol.Something]: 'hello world'
}


// Every time a property of an object is accessed, that is a property access
// regardless of the type value, for example a function, it's not magically
// a "method" at that point, there is nothing special about a function that
// comes from a property access, example:

function foo() {
  console.log("foo");
}

var someFoo = foo;

var myFoo = {
  someFoo: foo
};

console.log(foo); // function foo(){...}
console.log(someFoo); // function foo(){...}
console.log(myFoo.someFoo); // function foo(){...}

// soeFoo and myFooo are two separate references to thee same function
// and neither implies anything about the function being "owned" by any other object
// If foo() was defined to have a "this" reference inside it, that myFoo.someFoo
// implicit binding would be the only observable difference between the two references

// ES6 adds "super reference". The way super behaves (static binding) gives
// further weight to the idea that a function that is super-bound soewhere
// is more a "method" than a "function".

//  when you delcare a function expression as part of the object literal,
// the function doesnt magically belong more to the object there are still just
// multiple references to the same function:

var theObject = {
  foo: function foo() {
    console.log("foo");
  }
};



/*
  ARRAYS
*/

/*
// Arrays assume numertic indexing which means vakes are stored
// in locations called indecies
// Arrays are object, so even though each index is apositive integer,
// you can also add properties.
// Notice that adding named properties (regardless of [] operator syntax)
// does not change the length of the array ..

var someArray = ["foo", 42, "bar"];

console.log(someArray[0]);
console.log(someArray[2]);

someArray.baz = "baz";
console.log(someArray.length); //3
console.log(someArray.baz);

someArray["3"] = "baz";
console.log(someArray.length); //4



// Duplicating Objects
// Example:

var anotherFunction() {}

var anotherObject = {
  c: true
};

anotherArray = [];

var myObject = {
  a: 2,
  b: anotherObject, // Reference, not copy
  c: anotherFunction, // Another reference
  d: anotherArray
};

anotherArray.push(anotherObject, myObject);



// ES6 Object.assign(..)
// Takes target object as first parameter, and one more source object as second
// it iterates over all the enumerable owned keys on the source object(s)
// and copies them via "=" assignment, example:

var userObject = {
  name: "john",
  role: "admin"
};

// copy the userObject
var newObject = Object.assign( {}, userObject );
console.log(newObject.name); // john



// Property descriptors
var myObject = {
  a: 2
};

console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor( myObject, "a"));
// {value: 2, writable: true, enumerable: true, configurable: true}
// the property descriptor called "data descriptor" (holds value)


// we can use defineProperty(...) to add a new property,
// or modify an existing one if it is "configurable"

// Writable
// The abillity to change a value of a property is controlled by "writable"
// example:


var myObject = {};

Object.defineProperty( myObject, "a", {
  value: 2,
  writable: false,
  configurable: true,
  enumerable: true
});

myObject.a = 3;
console.log(myObject.a); // 2

// the modification of value "a" from "2" to "3" failed
// in strict mode we would get a "Type error"

// Configurable
// as long as property is currently configurable we can modify its
// descritors definition using the saeme defineProperty(...) utility

var myObject = {
  a: 2
}
myObject.a = 3;
console.log(myObject.a); // 3

Object.defineProperty( myObject, "a", {
  value: 4,
  writable: true,
  configurable: false,
  enumerable: true
});

console.log(myObject.a); // 4
myObject.a = 5;
console.log(myObject.a); // 5

// wll cast type error
Object.defineProperty( myObject, "a" , {
  value: 6,
  writable: true,
  configurable: true,
  enumerable: true
});


// Uncaught TypeError: Cannot redefine property: 'a' at Function.defineProperty (<anonymous>)
// results in TypeError regardless of strict-mode.
// another thing that "configurable: false" prevents is the abiliity to use
// the delete operator to remove an existing property..


// Immutability
// ES5 adds support for making objects / properties that cannot be changed.

// Object constant
// By combining writable:false and configurable: false  we can create constants
// (cannot be changed, redefined or deleted)

var myObject = {};

Object.defineProperty( myObject, "name", {
  value: "john",
  writable: false,
  configurable: false
});

console.log(myObject.name);

// Prevent extensions
// To preven an object from having new properties use: Object.preventExtensions(...)
Object.preventExtensions( myObject );
myObject.name = "dalalalala";
console.log(myObject.name); // name is still john


// Seal
// Object.seal(...) creates a "sealed" obect, which means it takes an existing object
// and calls "preventExtensions()" on it, also marks all "data accessor"
// properties as "configurable: false. Values can still be changed



// Freeze
// Object.freeze(...) creates a frozen object, which means it takes an existing object
// and calls seal() on it, but it also marks all data accessor properties as
// "writable: false", so that their values cannot be changed.




// [[GET]]
// there are important details about how accesses are performed, example:

var myObject = {
  a: 2
};
console.log(myObject.a); // 2

// myObject.a is a proterty access, but it doesnt just look in myObject
// for a property of the name "a", the previous code actualy perorms a
// [[Get]] operation (kind a like a function call [[Get]]()) on the myObject
// The default built-in [[Get]] operation for an object first inspects the object
// for a property of the requested name, if it finds it, it will return the value

// one important result of [[Get]] operation is that if it cannot find
// the requested property it instead returns the value of "undefnied"


// [[PUT]]
// Since there is an internally defined [[Get]] operation for getting a value
// from a property, it should be obvious there is also a default [[Put]]

// When ivoking [[Put]], how it behaves differs based on a number of factors.
// including whether the prperty is already present on the object or not

// If the property is present, the [[Put]] algorithm will roughly check:
// 1. Is the property an accessor descriptor, if so, call the setter, if any.
// 2. Is the property a data descriptor with "writable" of false, is so
// silently fail in non-strict mode, or throw TypeError in strict mode.
// 3. Otherwise set the value to the existing property as normal.
// If the property is not yet present on the object in question, the [[Put]]
// operation is event more complex..


// Getters and Setters
// The default Put and Get operations for objects completely control
// how values are are set to existing or new properties, or retrieved from exsting props.

//  ES5 introduced a way to override part of these default operations, not
// on an object level but per-property level through the use of getters/setters.
// Getters are properties that actually call a hidden function to retrieve a value
// Setters are properties that actually call a hdden function to set a value.
// When defining a property to have either a getter or setter, or both,
// its defenition becomes an "accessor descriptor"/"data descriptor"
// For  accessor descriptors, the value and writable characteristics of the descriptor
// are ignored, and instead JS considers the get and set characteristics of the property.
// Example:
var myObject = {
  get a() {
    return 2;
  }
};

Object.defineProperty(
  myObject, // target
  "b",      // protperty name
  {
            // define getter b
    get: function() {return this.a * 2},
    enumerable: true
  }
);

console.log(myObject.a); //2
console.log(myObject.b); // 4


// either through object-literal with "get a()" or through
// explicit defention defineProperty(), in both cases we created
// a property on the object that actually doesnt hold a value, but whose
// access automatically results in a hidden function call to the getter function.
// with whatever value it returns  being the result of the property access.

// since we only defned a getter for "a" if we try to set the value of later
// the "set" operation won't throw an error but will just silently throw
// the assignent away. Even if there was a valid setter, our custo getter is
// hardcoded to return only "2".

// Properties should be defined with setters. which override the default
// [[Put]] operation / "assignent" per-property, you most certainly want
// to declare both getters and setters


var myObject = {
  // define getter for 'a'
  get a() {
    return this._a_;
  },

  // define setter for 'a'
  set a(val) {
    this._a_ = val * 2;
  }
};

myObject.a = 2;
console.log(myObject.a); // 4

// in this example we store the specified value 2 of the assignment ([[Put]] operation)
// into  another variable '_a_.'. The name '_a_.' is purley by convention for this
// example and implies nothing special about its behaviour, - its a normal
// property like any other.

// Existance
// it is possible to ask an object if it has a certain property without
// asking to get that propertys value.

var myObject = {
  a: 2
};

console.log(("a"  in myObject)); // true
console.log(("b" in myObject)); // false
console.log(myObject.hasOwnProperty( "a" )); // true
console.log(myObject.hasOwnProperty( "b" )); // false

// The "in" operator will check to see f the property is in the object,
// or if it exists at any higher level of the [[Prototype]] chain object traversal
// hasOwnProperty(...) checks to see if only myObject has the property or not.



//Enumeration

var myObject = {};

  "a",

for (var k in myObject) {
  console.log(k, myObject[k]);

// myObject.b has an accessible value, but it doesnt show up in a for .. in loop
// Thats because "enumerable" false.

console.log(myObject.propertyIsEnumerable( "b" )); // false

console.log(Object.keys ( myObject )); // ["a"];
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames( myObject )); // ["a", "b"]

// propertyIsEnumerable(...) tests whether the given property name exists directly
// on the object and is also enumerable: true

// Object.keys(...) returns an array of all enumerable properties,
// whereas Object.getOwnPropertyNames(...) returns an array of all properties
// enumerable or not
// hasOwnProperty(...) differ in whether they consult the [[Property]] chain or not,
// Object.keys(...) and Object.getOwnPropertyNames(...) both inspect only the
// inderect object specified.
// Currently there is no way to get a list of all properties..


// Iteration
// The for ..in loop iterates over the list of enuerable properties on an object
// (includng its [[Prototype]] chain). But what if you instead want
// a standard for-loop like:

var myArray = [1,2,3];
for (var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
  console.log(myArray[i]); // 1 2 3
}
// this isnt iterating over the values, but iterating over the indices..
// where you then use the index to reference the value, as myArray[i]

//ES5 also added several iteration helpers for arrays,
// includng forEach(...), every(...) and some(...).
// Each of these helpers accepts a function callback to apply to each element
// in the array, differing only in how they respectively respond to a return
// value from the callback

// forEach(...) will iterate over all values in the array, and ignores any callback
// return values, every(...) keeps gong until the end or the callback returns
// a false (or "falsy") value, whereas some(...) keeps gong until the end or
// the callback returns a true or ("truthy") value.

// These special return values inside every(...) and some(...) act somewhat
// like a break statement insde a normal for loop, they stop the iteration
// early before it reaches the end.

// If you iterate on an object with a for..in loop you are also only
// getting at the values inderectly, because its actually iterating only
// over the enumerable properties of the object, leaving you to access the
// properties manually to get the values.


// what if we want to iterate over the values directly instead of the
// array indecies (or object properties) ? ES6 adds a for..of loop syntax
// for iterating over arrays (and objects, if the objects defines its own custom iterator)


var myArray = [1,2,3];

for (var v of myArray) {
  console.log(v); // 1 2 3
}


// the for..of loop asks for an iterator object of the thing to be iterated,
// and the loop then iterates over the succecssive return values from calling
// that iterator objects next() method, once for each loop iteration.

// arrays have abuilt-in @@iterator, so for..
/// But lets anually iterate the array, using the built-in @@ iterator:

var someArray = [1, 2, 3];
var it = someArray[Symbol.iterator]();

console.log(it.next()); // {value: 1, done: false}
console.log(it.next()); // {value: 2, done: false}
console.log(it.next()); // {value: 3, done: false}
console.log(it.next()); // {value: undefined, done: true}

// it is possible to define our own default @@iterator for any object
// example:

var myObject = {
  a: 2,
  b: 3
};

Object.defineProperty( myObject, Symbol.iterator, {
  enuerable: false,
  writable: false,
  configurable: true,
  value: function() {
    var o = this;
    var idx = 0;
    var ks = Object.keys( o );
    return {
      next: function() {
        return {
          value: o[ks[idx++]],
          done: (idx > ks.length)
        };
      }
    };
  }
});

// iterate manually
var it = myObject[Symbol.iterator]();
console.log(it.next()); // {value: 2, done: false}
console.log(it.next()); // {value: 3, done: false}
console.log(it.next()); // {value: undefined, done: true}

// iterate wit for..of
for (var v of myObject) {
  console.log(v); // 2 3
}

// we used Object.defineProperty() on myObject to define our custom
// @@iterator, but we could have declared it directly:
//myObject = {a:2, b:3, [Symbol.iterator]: function() {  }}

// Random generator

var randoms = {
  [Symbol.iterator]: function() {
    return {
      next: function() {
        return {
          value: Math.random() };
      }
    };
  }
};


var randoms_pool = [];
for (var n of randoms) {
  randoms_pool.push(n);
  console.log(n);
  if(randoms_pool.length == 100) break;
}

// Objects in JS have both a literal form such as:
// var a = {...} and a constructed form like: var = new Array(...)
// the literal form is almost always preferred, but the constructed form
// offers, in some cases more creation options

// Objects are one of the primitive types.
// objects have subtypes, including function and can be behaviour-specialized like
// [object Array] as the internal label representing the array object subtype.

// Objects are collections of key/value pairs. The values can be accessed as properties
// via the .propName or ["propName"] syntax. Whenever a property is accessed
// the engine actually invokes the internal default [[Get]] operation.

// Properties have certain characteristics that can be controlled through property descriptors, such
// as 'writable' and 'configurable', in addition objects can have their Immutability controlled
// to various levels of Immutability using object.preventExtensions(), Object.seal().. Object.freeze(...)
// properties dontt have to contains values, they can be accesor properties as well, with
// getters and setters. They can also be either enumerable or not, which controlls wheter they show
// up in for...loop iterations.




//
  PROTOTYPE
//

// Objects in javascript have an internal property, denoted in the specification
// as [[Prototype]], which is simply a reference to another object.
// Almost all objects are given a non-null value for this property at the time
// of their creation.

// It is possible fr an object to have an empty [[Prototype]] linkage, though this is less common

var myObject = {
  a: 2
};
console.log(myObject.a); // 2

// The default [[Get]] ioeration proceeds to follow the [[Prototype]] link if the object
// cannot find the requested property on the object directly.


var anotherObject = {
  a: 2
};

// create an object linkted to anotherObject()
var someObj = Object.create( anotherObject );
console.log(someObj.a); // 2

// So we have someObj that is now [[Prototype]] linked to anotherObject
// Clearly someObj.a doesnt actually exist, but nevertheless the property
// access succeeds (being found on anotherObj instead and finds value 2)

// but if 'a' werent found on anotherObj either, its [[Prototype]] chain,
// if nonempty, is again consulted and followed.
// The process continues untl ether a matchng property name is found,
// or the [[PrototyÃ¥e]]  chain ends. If no matching property is ever found
// by the end of the chain, the return result from the [[Get]] operation is undefined


// Smiliar to this [[Prototype]] chain lookup process, if you use
// for..in-loop to iterate over an object, any property that can be reached
// via its chain will be enumerated. If you use the 'in' operator to test
// for the existance of a property on an object, 'in' will check the entire chain of the
// object regardlesss of enumerability.

var anotherObject = {
  a:2
};

// create an object linked to 'anotherObject'
var myObject = Object.create( anotherObject );

for (var k in myObject) {
  console.log("found: ", k); // found 'a'
}

console.log(("a" in myObject)); // true

// Object.prototype
// Setting and shadowing properties

myObject.foo = "bar";


// if the myObject object already has a normal data accessor property called 'foo'
// directly present on it, the assignment is as smiple as changing the value of
// the existing property.
// If foo is not already present directly on myObject, the [[Prototype]] chan is traversed
// just like for the [[Get]] operation, if Foo is not found anywhere in the chain
// the property foo is added directly to myObject with the specified vaule as expected.

// if foo is already present somewhere hgher in the chain, behaviour can occur with the
// myObject.foo = "bar" assignent.

// If the property name of foo ends up both on myObject itself and at a higher level
// of the [[Prototype]] chain that starts at myObject, this is called 'shadowing'
// the foo property directly on myObject shadows any foo property that appears higher
// in the chain, because myObject.foo lookup would find the foo property thats lowest in the chain

// if foo is found higher on the [[Prototype]] chain and its a setter, then the
// setter will always be called, no foo will be added t0 myObject, nor will the foo setter
// be redefined.

// shadowing can even occur implicitly in subtle ways, care must be taken if
// trying to avoid it, example:

var anotherObject = {
  a: 2
};

var myObject = Object.create ( anotherObject );
console.log(anotherObject.a); // 2
console.log(myObject.a); // 2

console.log(anotherObject.hasOwnProperty("a"));  // true
console.log(myObject.hasOwnProperty("a")); // false

myObject.a++;
console.log(anotherObject.a); // 2
console.log(myObject.a); // 3

console.log(myObject.hasOwnProperty("a")); // true

// Though it may appear that myObject.a+++ should via delegation look up and
// just increment the anotherObject.a property itself in place,
// instead the ++ operation corresponds to myObject.a = myObject.a + 1;
// the result is [[Get]] looking up a property via [[Prototype]] to get the current
// value 2 from anotherObject.a, incrementing the value by one. then [[Put]] assigning
// the value 3 to a new shadowed property on myObject...

// Be careful when dealing with delegated properties that you modify.
// If you want to increment anotherObject.a, the only proper way os
// anotherObject.a++;


// "Class functions"
// there is a peculiar kind of behavior n js that has been shamelessly abused for years
// to hack something that looks like classes..

function Foo() {
  // ...
}

Foo.prototype // { }

// this object is often called "Foo's prototype" because we access it via a named
// Foo.prototype property reference

// The most direct way to explain this is that each object created from calling
// new Foo() will end up somewhat arbitrarily [[Prototype]] linked to this object.

function Foo() {
  //..
}
var a = new Foo();
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(a) === Foo.prototype); // true

// When 'a' is created by calling new Foo() one of the thing that happens is
// that 'a' gets an internal [[Prototype]] link to the object that Foo.Prototype is
// pointing at.

// In class-oriented languages multiple instances of a class can be made.
// But in Javascript there is no such copy actions performed.
// YOu dont create multiple instances of a class, you can create multiple objects
// that are [[Prototype]] linked to a common object. But by default no copying occurs.
// and thus these objects dont end up totally separate and disconnected from each other,
// but rather quite 'linked',

// new Foo() results in a new object, and that new object 'a is internally [[Prototype]]
// linked to the Foo.Prototype object. We end up with two objects, linked to each other.
// Thats it, we didnt instanciate a class, we certainly did not do any copying,
// we justed caused two object to be linked to each other.

// In javascript we dont make copies from one object ("class")  to anther ("instance")
// we make links between objects. FOr the [[Prototype]] mechanism, visually, the arrows
// move from right to left, and from bottom to top.
// This mechanism is often called prototypal inheritance.





// Constructors
function Foo() {
  // ...
}
var a = new Foo();

// What leads us to think that Foo is a class?
// For one we see the use of the 'new' keyword, for another it appears that we are
// in fact executing a constructor method of a class because Foo() is actually
// a method that gets called just like how a real class's constructor gets called when instantiated.



function Foo() {
  // ...
}

console.log(Foo.prototype.constructor === Foo); // true
var a = new Foo();
console.log(a.constructor === Foo); // true

// The Foo.prototype object by default gets a public nonenumerable propery called
// .constructor, and this property is a reference back to the function Foo that the object
//is associated with. Moreover we see that object 'a' created by the constructor call new Foo()
// seems to also have a property on it called .constructor, which similarly points to
// the function which created it.



// Functions themselves are not functions, however when you put the 'new'
// keyword in front of a normal function call, that makes that function call
// a constructor call, in fact 'new' sort of hijack any normal function and
// calls it in a fashion that constructs an object


function NothingSpecial() {
  console.log("Constructor call");
}

var a = new NothingSpecial(); // "Constructor call"

// Functions arent constructors, but function calls are constructor calls
// if and only if 'new' is used.


// Mechanics
// JS developers have strived to simulate as much as they can f class orientaton

function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.name = function() {
  this.name = name;
}

var john = new Person("john");
console.log(john.name); // "john"

// This snippet shows additional "class orientation" tricks
// this.name = name adds the .name property onto object 'john'.

 // Foo.prototype.name = ... is perhaps the more interesting technique, this
 // adds a property (function) to the Person.prototype object making
 // john.name work.


 // in the previous snippet its stronlgy tempting to think that when john is created
 // the properties/functions on the Person.prototype object are copied over
 // to john object, however thats not what happens.

 // John ends up with an internal [[Prototype]] linkage to Person.prottotype.
 // When name is not found n john, its instead found (through delegation) on Person.prototype

 // "Constructor" Redux
 // it seems like john.constructor === Person being true means that that
 // john has an actual .constructor peroperty on it, pointing to Person? Not correct..
 // This is just unfortunate confusion, in actuality the .constructor reference
 // is also  delegated up to Person.prototype which happens to, by default have
 // a .constructor that points to Person.

// It seems conventient that an object 'john' 'constructed by' Person would
// have access to person.constructor  property that points to Person...
// But thats nothing more than a false sense of security. It a happy accident, almost
// tangentially, that john.constructor HAPPENS to point at Person via this default
// [[Prototype]] delegation.

// the .constructor property on Person.prototype is only there by default on the
// object created when Person the function is declared.
// If you create a new object and replace a functions default .prototype object reference
// the new object will not by default magcally get a .constructor on it.
// example:


function Foo() { }
Foo.prototype = { }
var a1 = new Foo();
console.log(a1.constructor === Foo); // false
console.log(a1.constructor === Object); // true

// Object(..) did not construct a1? it sure seems like Foo()
// constructed it, most developers think of Foo() as doing the construction
// but where everythng falls apart is when you think "constructor" means
// "was contructed by", because by that reasoning a1.constructor should be Foo,
// but it isnt.

// a1 has no .constructor property, so it delegates up the [[Prototype]] chain to
// Foo.prototype. But that object doesnt have a .constructor ether, so it keeps
// delegating, this time up to Object.prototype, the top of the delegation chain,
// that object indeed has a .constructor on it, which points to the default Object(..) function
// Of course you can add .constructor back to the Foo.prototype object, but this takes
// manual work, especially if you want to match native behaviour and have it be nonenumerable
// example:


function Foo() { };
Foo.prototype = { }; // creates a new prototype object
// properly fix the missing .constructor property on the new object serving as Foo.prototype

Object.defineProperty( Foo.prototype, "constructor", {
  enumerable: false,
  writable: true,
  configurable: true,
  value: Foo // point '.constructor' at 'Foo'
});

var a1 = new Foo();
console.log(a1.constructor == Foo); // true

// all we are really doing s perpetuating the misconception that "constructpr"
// means "was constructed by"...
// The fact is .constructor on an object arbitrarily points, by default at
// a function that, reciprocally has a reference back t the object -
// a reference that it calls .prototype. The words "constructor" and "prototype"
// only have loose default meanng that ight or might not hold true later.
// The best thing to do is remind yourself that "constructor" does not mean "constructed by".
// a1 constructor is extremly unreliable and its an unsafe reference
// to rely upon in your code. Generally such reference should be avoided when possible.


// Prototypal inheritance
// Prototype-style

function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.name = function() {
  return this.name;
}

function User(name, id) {
  Person.call(this, name);
  this.id = id;
}

// here we make a new User.prototype linked to Person.prototype
User.prototype = Object.create( Person.prototype );

User.prototype.id = function() {
  return this.id;
};

var admin = new User("john", "1");
console.log(admin.name); // john
console.log(admin.id); // 1

// The important part is User.prototype = Object.create(...)
// tHE CALL TO Object.create creates a "new" object out of thin air, and links
// the new objects internal [[Prototype]] to the oject you specify (User.prototype)
// In other words that line says "make a new USer.prototype thats linked to Person.prototype"

// WHen function User() is declared, User like any other function has a .prototype
// link to its default object, but that object is not linked to Person.prototype
// like we want. So we create a new object that is linked as we want.

// A common misconception here is that either of the following approaches would
// also work, but they do not work as you expect:

// this doesnt work like we want ..
User.prototype = Person.prototype;

// works kinda like we want but with sideeffect we do not want
User.prototype = new Person();


// User.prototype = Person.prototype doesnt create a new object for User.prototype
// to be linked to. It just makes User.prototype another reference to Person.prototype
// which effectively links User directly to the same object to which Person links: Person.prototype
// This means when you start assigning, like User.prototype.id = "" you are odifying not
// a separate object but the shared User.prototype object itself,which
// would affect any objects linked to Person.prototype.
// If this is what we want, then we likely dont need User at all, and should
// use Person and make the code simpler.

//User.prototype = new Person() does in fact create a new object that is
// duly linked to Person.prototype as we want, but it used the Person() constructor
// call to do it.

// so we are left with using Object.create(..) to make a new object thats properly linked.


// Pre-ES6
// Throws away the default existing Bar.prototype
Bar.prototype = Object.create(Foo.prototype);

// ES6+
// modifies existing Bar.prototype
Object.setPropertyOf(Bar.prototype, Foo.prototype);


// Inspecting "Class" relationships
// If we have an object and want to find out what object it delegates to,
// inspecting an instance (just an object in js) for its inheritance ancestry
// (delegation linkage in js) is oftren called instrospection / reflection
// in class-oriented enviroments.
// example:

function Foo() {
  // ..
}
Foo.prototype.blah = "blah blah";
var a = new Foo();

console.log((a instanceof Foo)); //  True


// The instanceof operator takes a plain object as its lefthand operand
// and a function as its righthand operand. The question nstanceof answer is:
// in the entire [[Prototype]]chain of a, does the object arbitrarily pointed
// to by Foo.prototype ever appear?
// This means that you can only inquire about the "ancestry" of some object (a)
// if you have some function to test with.


// THs sinppet illustrates the ridiculosness of trying to reason about
// relationships between two objects using "class" semantics and instanceof:

// helper utility to see if o1 is related to o2
function isRelatedTo(o1, o2) {
  function F() {}
  F.prototype = o2;
  return 01 instanceof F;
}

var a = {};
var b = Object.create( a );

console.log(isRelatedTo(b, a)); // False


// Creating Links
// Whats the point of the [[Prototype]] mechanism?
// Why is it so comon for JS developers to get so much effort emulating
// classes in ther code to wire up these linkages?

// We said Object.create(..) would help us out, example:

var foo = {
  something: function() {
    console.log("something");
  }
};

var bar = Object.create( foo );
bar.something; // something

// Object.create(...)  creates a new object bar linked to the object we specified (foo)
// which gives is all the power (delegation) of the [[Prototype]] mechanism,
// but without any of the unnecessary complication of new functions acting as classes
// and constructor calls, confusing .prototype and .constructor references.

// Oject.create(null) creates an object that has an empty [[Prototype]] linkage,
// and thus the object cant delegate anywhere. Since such an object has no
// prototype chain. The instanceof operator has nothing to check, so it
// will return false. These specal empty [[Prototype]] objects are often
// called dictionaries as they are typically used purley for storing data in properties.
// Mostly because they have no possible surprise effects from any delegated
// properties / functions on the get [[Prototype]]  chain, and are thus purley flat data storage.


// We dont need classes to create meaningful relationshops between two objects.
// The only thing we should really care about is obects lined togeheter for
// delegation, and Object.create(...) gives is that linkage without all class stuff.


// Object.create() polyfill
// Object.create() was added in ES5, we might need to support PRE ES5 enviroments .

if(!Object.create) {
  Object.create = function(o) {
    function F(){}
    F.prototype = o;
    return new F();
  };
}

// This polyfill works by throwaway F function, and we override its .prototype
// property to point to the object we want to link to Then we use F() construction
// to make a new object that will be linked as specified.


// For copleteness lets look at that additinal functionallity

var anotherObject = {
    a:2
};

var myObject = Object.create ( anotherObject, {
  b: {
    enumerable: false,
    writable: true,
    configurable: false,
    value: 3
  },
  c: {
    enumerable: false,
    writable: false,
    configurable: false,
    value: 4
  }
});

console.log(myObject.hasOwnProperty("a")); // false
console.log(myObject.hasOwnProperty("b")); // true
console.log(myObject.hasOwnProperty("c")); // true

console.log(myObject.a); // 2
console.log(myObject.b); // 3
console.log(myObject.c); // 4

// The second argument to Object.create(..) specifies property names to add
// to the newly created object, via declaring each new properties property descriptor.
// Because polyfilling property descriptors into PRE-ES5 is not possible, this
// additional functionality on Object.create(..) cannot be polyfilled.

// In ES5 enviroment instead of polyfilling you should ue a custom utillity, and
// stay away from using the name Object.create entirely. You could instead
// define your own utility. Example:

function createAndLinkObject(o) {
  function F(){}
  F.prototype = o;
  return new F();
}

var anotherObject = {
  a:2
};

var myObject = createAndLinkObject( anotherObject );
console.log(myObject.a); // 2




// CLas design pattern
// The class design pattern encourages you to method overriding to get
// ost out of inheritance


Task = {
  setID: function() { this.id = ID; },
  outputID: function() { console.log( this.id ); }
}

// make XYZ delegate to Task
XYZ = Object.create( Task );

XYZ.prepareTask = function(ID, Label) {
  this.setID( ID );
  this.label = Label;
};

XYZ.outputTaskDetails = function() {
  this.outputID();
  console.log(this.label);
};

// In this code. Task and XYZ are not classes (or functions) theyare just
// objects, XYZ is set up via Object.create(..) to [[Prototype]]-delegate to the
// task object
// AS compared to class orientation we can call this stile of code OLOO
//(objects linked to other objects)
// All we really care about is that XYZ object delegates to the Task object
// IN javascript the [[Prototype]] mmechanism links objects to other objects,
// there are no abstract mechanisms like "classes",
// Some other differences to note with OLOO style code:

// 1. Both the id and label data members fro the previous class-example
// are data properties directly on XYZ (neither in Task)
//In general with [[Prototype]] delegation, you want stsate to be on the delegators
// XYZ, not the delegate Task.

// 2. With the class design pattern we intentoinally named output Task the same
// on both parent (Task) and child (XYZ) so that we could take advantage of
// overriding. In behaviour delegation, we do the opposite, we  avoid if at all
// possible naming things the sae at dfferent levels of the [[Prototype]] chain
//(called shadowing) because having those name collisions creates awkard syntax.

// The design pattern calls for less use of general ethod names that are prone
// to overriding and instead more uue of descriptive method names, specific to
// the type of behaviour each object is doing. Thi can actually create easier to understand
// / maintain  code, because names of methods are more obvious / self-documenting.

// 3. thi.setID(ID); inside of a method on the XYZ object first looks on XYZ for setID(..)
// but ince it doesnt find a ethod of that name on XYZ, [[Prototype]] delegation means
// it can follow the link to Task to look fir setID(..), which it of course finds.


// Lets examine some more theoretical Foo/Bar code, and compare
// both ways (OO versus OLOO) of implementing the code.
// The first snippet uses the classical ("prototypal") OO-style:

function Foo(who) {
  this.me = who;
};

Foo.prototype.identify = function() {
  return "I am " + this.me;
}

function Bar(who) {
  Foo.call( this, who);
}
Bar.prototype = Object.create ( Foo.prototype );

Bar.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log("Hello " + this.identify() + ".");
};

var b1 = new Bar("b1");
b1.speak();

// Parent class Foo is inherited by child clas Bar, which is instantiated once
// as b1, b1 delegates to bar.prototype, which delegates to Foo.prototype.
// Lets implement the sae functionality using OLOO-style.


Foo = {
  init: function(who) {
    this.me = who;
  },
  identify: function() {
    return "I am " + this.me;
  }
}

Bar = Object.create(Foo);

Bar.speak = function() {
  console.log("Hello, " + this.identify() + ".");
};

var b1 = Object.create(Bar);
b1.init("b1");
b1.speak();


// We take exactly the sae advantage of [[Prototype]] delegation from
// b1 to Bar to Foo as we did in the previous snippet betweet b1, Bar.prototype
// and Foo.prototypr, we still have the three objects linked together.

// Classes versus objects
// Lets now look at more concrete code scenarios to show howd you actually
// use these ideas. Well first examine a typical scenario in frontend web-deb
// Creating UI widgets (buttons, drop-downs etc)


// Widget "classes"


// Parent class
function Widget(width, height) {
  this.width = width || 50;
  this.height = height || 50;
  this.$elem = null;
}

Widget.prototype.render = function($where) {
  if (this.$elem) {
    this.$elem.css( {
      width: this.width + "px",
      height: this.height + "px"
    }).appendTo($where);
  }
};

// Child class
function Button(width, height, label) {
  // "super" constructor call
  Widget.call( this, width, height);
  this.label = label || "Default";

  this.$elem = $( "<button>" ).text(this.label);
}
//make button "inherit" from 'widget'
Button.prototype = Object.create( Widget.prototype );

// override base "inhertied" 'render(..)'
Button.prototype.render = function($where) {
  // super call
  Widget.prototype.render.call( this, $where );
  this.$elem.click( this.onClick.bind( this ) );
};

Button.prototype.onClick = function(evt) {
  console.log("Button " + this.label + " clicked");
}

$(document).ready(function() {
  var $body = $(document.body);
  var btn1 = new Button( 125, 30, "hello");
  var btn2 = new Button( 125, 30, "world");

  btn1.render($body);
  btn2.render($body);
});


// ES6 Class sugar
// Lets implement the same code using class

class Widget {
  constructor(width, height) {
    this.width = width || 50;
    this.height = height || 50;;
    this.$elem = null;
  }
  render($were) {

      }).appendTo($where);
    }
  }
}
class Button extends Widget {

//With this OLO style we dont think of widget as a parent and Button as a child.

// Simpler design
// Following the typical  class design attern, well put the base functionality of the
// task in a class called Controller, and then well derive two child classes,
// LoginController and AuthController, which both inhert from Controller,
// and specialize soe of thse base behaviours:


// Parent class

function Controller() {
  this.errors = [];
}
Controller.prototype.showDialog = function(title, msg) {
  // display title & message to user in dialog
};
Controller.prototype.success = function(msg) {
  this.showDialog("Success", msg);
};
Controller.prototype.failure = function(err) {
  this.errors.push(err);
  this.showDialog("Error: ", err);
};

// Child class
function LoginController() {
  Controller.call( this );
}
// Link child class to parent
LoginController.prototype = Object.create( Controller.prototype );

LoginController.prototype.getUser = function() {
  return document.getElementById( "login_username" ).value;
};
LoginController.prototype.getPassword = function() {
  return document.getElementById( "login_password" ).value;
};
LoginController.prototype.validateEntry = function(user, pw) {
  user = user || this.getUser();
  pw = pw || this.getPassword();

  if(!(user && pw)) {
    return this.failure("please enter a username & password");
  }
  else if (pw.length < 5) {
    return this.failure("password must be 5+ characters");
  }
  // validated user
  return true;
};

// override to extend base 'failure()'
LoginController.prototype.failure = function(err) {
  // super call
  Controller.prototype.failure.call(this, "login invalid: " + err);
};

// Child class
function AuthController(login) {
  Controller.call( this );
  // In addition to inheritance, we also need composition
  this.login = login;
}
// link child class to parent
AuthController.prototype = Object.create( Controller.prototype );
AuthController.prototype.server = function(url, data) {
  return $.ajax({
    url: url,
    data: data
  });
};

AuthController.prototype.checkAuth = function() {
  var user = this.login.getUser();
  var pw = this.login.getPassword();

  if(this.login.validateEntry( user, pw )) {
    this.server( "/check-auth" , {
      user: user,
      pw: pw
    })
    .then( this.success.bind( this ))
    .fail( this.failure.bind( this ));
  }
};
// Override to extend base 'success()'
AuthController.prototype.success = function() {
  // Super call
  Controller.prototype.success.call( this, "Authenticated" );
};

// Override to extend base 'failure()'
AuthController.prototype.failure = function(err) {
  // super call
  Controller.prototype.failure.call( this, "Auth failed: " + err);
};

var auth = new AuthController(
  new LoginController()
);
auth.checkAuth();





// Types
// Undefined, Null, Boolean, String, Number, Object, Symbol(added in ES6)
// ALl of the Types above are called "primitives", except for object

console.log(typeof undefined); // undefined
console.log(typeof true); // boolean
console.log(typeof 42); // number
console.log(typeof "42"); // string
console.log(typeof { life: 43 }); // object
console.log(typeof Symbol()); // symbol
// null is still bugged out ... shows up as object
console.log(typeof function a(){}); // function

// function is a subtype of object, a function is refferred to as a "callable object"
// an object that has an internal [[Call]] property that allows it to be invoked
// the fact that function are actually objects is quite useful, most importantly
// they can have properties, example:

function a(x,y) {
  // ...
}
// function object has a length property set to the number of formal parameters its delcared with
console.log(a.length); // 2

// arrays are objects, numerically indexed
console.log(typeof [1,2,3]); // object

// Value as Types
// In JS variables do not have types, values has types, variables can hold values
// undefined vs "undeclared"
// Variables that have no value currently actually have the undefined value
// Calling typeof against such a variable will return "undefined"

var z;
console.log(typeof z); // undefined

// An undefined variable is one that has been declared in the accessible scope
// but at the moment has no other value in it. By contrast an "undeclared" variable
// is one that has not been formally declared in the accessible scrope, example:
var p;
console.log(p); // undefined
//console.log(k); // ReferenceError: k is not defined
// undefined and not defined are very different things.

// the typeof operator returns "undefined" even for "undeclared"/"not defined" variables
var o;
console.log(typeof o); // undefined
console.log(typeof l); // undefined

// as simple example, imagine having a "debug mode" in your program that is controlled
// by a global variable (flag) calld DEBUG, youd want tot check if that variable was
// delcared before performing a debug task like loggin a message to the console.
// A top-level global var DEBUG = true delaration would only be included in a
// debug.js file, which you load only into the browser when youare in development/testing
// and not in production

// Ops this would throw an error
 /*
if (DEBUG) {
  console.log("Debugging is starting");
}
 */
/*
// this is a safe existence check
if (typeof DEBUG != "undefined") {
  console.log("Debugging is starting");
  atob = function() {}
}

if (typeof atob === "undefined") {
  atob = function(){};
}

// another way of doing these checks against global variables but without safety
// guard feature of typeof is to observe that all global variables are also properties
// of the global object, whch in the briwser is basically a window object.
// so the above checks could have been done as:

if (window.DEBUG) {
  console.log("if (window.DEBUG) {}");
}

if (!window.atob) {
  console.log("if (!window.atob) {}");
}


// unlike referencing undeclared variables, there is no ReferenceError thrown if you
// try you try to access an object property that doesnt exist
// The safety guard on typeof is useful even if you are not using global variables
// Imagine a utility function that you want others to copy-paste into ther programs
// or modules, in which you want to check to see f the including program has defined
// a certain variable so you can use it or not, example:
function doFoo() {
  var helper = (typeof FeatureX !== "undefined") ? FeatureX : function() { }
  var val = helper();
  //
}
// doFoo tests for a variable called FeatureX and if found uses it, if not uses its own

// Some developers would prefer a design called "dependecy injection" where instead
// of doFoo() inspecting implicitly for FeatureX to be defined outside/around it,
// it would need to have the dependecy explicitly passed in like:

function doBar() {
  var helper =  FeatureX || function() {}
  var val = helper();
}

// Values
// Arrays

// Arrays in JS are just containers for any type of value, even other arrays, (multidimensional arrays)
var a = [1, "2", [3]];
console.log(a.length);


// Using delete on an array value will remove that slot from the array
// but even if you remove that final element, it does not update the length property

// arrays are numerically indexed, but the tricky thing is that they also are objects
// that can have string keys/properties added to them which not count towards the length

var a = [];
a[0] = 1;
a["foobar"] = 2;
console.log(a.length); // 1
console.log(a["foobar"]); // 2
console.log(a.foobar); // 2

// A gotcha to be aware of is that if a string vaalue intended as a key can be coerced
// to a standard base 10-value number, then it is assumed that you wanted to use
// a number index rather than as a string key
var a = [];
a["13"] = 42;
console.log(a.length); // 14

// Array-Likes
// There will be occasions where you need to convert an array-like value
// into a true array, usually so you can call array utilities like indexof() concat()
// forEach() etc..

// Various DOM query operations return lists of DOM elements that are not true arrays
// but are array-like enough for our conversion purposes, another common example is when
// functions expose the arguments object (as of ES6 deprecated) to access the argument list
// a very common way to make such a conversion is to borrow the slice() utility against the value

function foo() {
  var arr = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
  console.log(arr);
}
foo("foo", "bar", "baz"); // ["foo", "bar", "baz"]
// if slice() is called without any other parameters as it effectively is
// in the above snippet, the default values for its parameters have the effect of
// duplicating the array (or in this case array-like)

// As of ES6 theres also a built-in utility called Array.from(..) that can do the same taks
function foo() {
  var arr = Array.from(arguments)
  console.log(arr);
}
foo("foo", "bar", "baz"); // ["foo", "bar", "baz"]

// Strings
// JS strings are really not the same as arrays of character,
// exaple:

var a = "foo";
var b = ["f", "o", "o"];

// strings do have a shallow reseblance to arrays, they are array-likes as above
// FOr instance both of the have a length property, an indexOf(..) and concat(..)

console.log(a.length); // 3
console.log(b.length); // 3
console.log(a.indexOf("o")); // 1
console.log(b.indexOf("o")); // 1

var c = a.concat("bar")
var d = b.concat(["b", "a", "r"]);
console.log(c); // foobar
console.log(d); // ["f", "o", "o", "b", "a", "r"]

a[1] = "O";
b[1] = "O";
console.log(a); // foo
console.log(b); // ["f", "O", "o"]

// Strings are immutable, while arrays are qute mutable. Moreover the a[1] character
// position access from was not always valid javascript. Older versions of IE did not
// allow that syntax (now they do) Intead the correct approach has been a.charAt(1)

// A further consequence of immutable strings is that none of the string methods that alter
// its contents can modify in-place, but rather must create a return new strings,
// by contrast many of the array methods that can change array contents actually do modify
// in-place

c = a.toUpperCase();
console.log(a === c); //false
console.log(a); // foo
console.log(c); // FOO

b.push("!")
console.log(b); // ["f", "O", "o", "!"]

// Also, many of the array methods that could be helpful when dealing with string
// are not actually available for them, but we can borrow nonmutation array methods

console.log(a.join); // undefined
console.log(a.map); // undefined

var c = Array.prototype.join.call( a, "-");
var d = Array.prototype.map.call( a, function(v) {
  return v.toUpperCase() + "."
}).join( "" );

console.log(c); // f-o-o
console.log(d); // F.O.O.


// Another example, reversing a string. Arrrays have a reverse() in-place mutator
// method but strings do not

console.log(a.reverse); // undefined
console.log(b.reverse()); // ["!", "o", "O", "f"]
// the "borrowing" does not work with array mutators, because strings are immutable
// and thus  cant be modified in place

// Another workaround is to convert the string into an array, perform the desire
// operation, then convert it back to a string, example:


//split 'a' into an array of characters, reverse the array of characters,
// join the array of characters back to a string
var c = a.split("").reverse().join("");
console.log(c); // oof


// Numbers
// Javascript has only one numeric type, number. THis type includes both
// integer values and fractional decimal numbers.
// 42.0 is just as much an integer as 42
// The implementation of JS numbers is based on the "IEEE 754 standard",
// often called "floating-point". Javascript specifically uses the
// "double precision" format, aka 64-bit binary

// numeric syntax
// number literals are expressed in javascript generally as base-10 decimal literals
// example:
var a = 42;
var b = 42.3;

// The leading portion of a decimal value, if 0, is optional:
var a = 0.42;
var b = .42;

// Simlilarly the trailnig portion (the fractional) of a decimal value after the
// . if 0, is optional:
var a = 42.0;
var b = 42.;

// By default most nubers will be outputted as a base-10 decimals, with
// trailing fractional 0s removed.


// Because number values can be boxed with the number object wrapper
// number values can access methods that are built into the number.prototype
// FOr example the toFixed(...) method allows you to specify how many fractional
// decimal places youd like the value to be represented with
var a = 42.59;
console.log(a.toFixed(0)); // 43
console.log(a.toFixed(1)); // 42.6
console.log(a.toFixed(2)); // 42.59
console.log(a.toFixed(3)); // 42.590
console.log(a.toFixed(4)); // 42.5900

// notice that the output is actually a string representation of the number, and
// that the value is 0-padded on the righthand side if you ask for more decimals
// then the value holds, toPrecision(..) is similiar but specifies how many significant
// digits should be used to represent the value

var a = 42.59;
console.log(a.toPrecision(1)); // 4e+1
console.log(a.toPrecision(2)); // 43
console.log(a.toPrecision(3)); // 42.6
console.log(a.toPrecision(4)); // 42.59


// You dont have to use a variable with the value in it to access these methods
// you can access these methods directly on the number literals.
// BUt you have to be carefukl with the '.' operator since '.' is a valid
// numeric chartacter. it will first be interpreted as part of the number literal
// if possible, instead of being interpreted as a property accessor

//console.log(42.toFixed(3)); // Syntax Error

console.log((42).toFixed(3)); // 42.000
console.log(0.42.toFixed(3)); // 0.420
console.log(42..toFixed(3)); // 42.000

// 42.toFixed(3) is invalid syntax, because tje . is swallowed up as
// part of the 42. literal, and so then theres no . property operator
// present to make the .toFixed access

// 42..toFixed(3) works because the first . is part of the number and the second
// . os the property operator. Looks ugly though
// This is also technically valid..
console.log(42 .toFixed(3)); // 42.000


// number literals can also be specified in exponent form, which is common
// when representing large numbers, example:
var onethousand = 1E3;
var onemillionhundredthousand = 1.E6;
console.log(onethousand); // 1000
console.log(onemillionhundredthousand); // 1000000

// number literals can also be expressed in other bases, like binary-octal
// and hexadecimal
console.log(0xf3); // 243
console.log(0363); // 243

// Starting with ES6+ strict mode, the 0363 form of octal literals is no loger allowed
// The 0363 form is still allowed in non-strict-mode. But you should stop using
// it anyway, to be future friendly, and because you should be using strict-mode.

// as of ES6 the following forms are also valuid:
console.log(0o363); // 243
console.log(0b11110011); // 243

// small decial values
// The most (in)famous side effect of using binary floating-point numbers
// is:
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3); // false

// Now the question is, if some numbers cant be trusted?
// there are some applications where you need to be more careful,
// especially when dealing wth fractional decimal values.
// The mmost accepted practise is to use a "tiny rounding error" value as tolerance
// For comparison. Ths tiny value is often called "machine epsilon"

// As of ES6 Number .EPSILON is predefined with this tolerance value,
// so youd want to use it, but you can safely polyfill the definition for pre-ES6

if(!Number.EPSILON) {
  Number.EPSILON = Math.pow(2,-52);
}

// We can use this Number.EPSILON to compare two numbers for "equality"
// within the rounding error tolerance

function numbersCloseEnoughToEqual(n1, n2) {
  return Math.abs( n1 - n2 ) < Number.EPSILON;
}

var a = 0.1 + 0.2;
var b = 0.3;
console.log(numbersCloseEnoughToEqual(a, b)); // true
console.log(numbersCloseEnoughToEqual(0.0000001, 0.0000002)); // false

// The maximum floating point value that can be represented is roughly
// 1.798e+308, predefined for you as Number .MAX_VALUE. On the small end,
// Number.MIN_VALUE is roughly 5e-324, whch isnt negative but close to zero.

// Safe integer ranges
// Because of how numers are representedmthere is a range of "safe" values for
// the whole number integers, and its significantly less than Number.MAX_VALUE.

// THe maximum integer that can be safely represented is 2^53 - 1
// which is around 9 quadrillion.

// This value is actually automatically predefined in ES6, as Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER.
// there is also a minimum value, Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER.

// Testing for integers
// To test if a value is an integer you can use the ES6-specified Number.isInteger(..)

console.log(Number.isInteger(42)); // true
console.log(Number.isInteger(42.000)); // true
console.log(Number.isInteger(42.3)); // false

// Polyfill isInterger()

if (!Number.isInteger) {
  Number.isInteger = function(num) {
    return typeof num == "number" && num % 1 == 0;
  };
}

// to test if a value is a safe integer, use the ES6 specified Number.isSafeInteger(...)

console.log(Number.isSafeInteger(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)); // true
console.log(Number.isSafeInteger(Math.pow(2, 53))); // false
console.log(Number.isSafeInteger(Math.pow(2, 53) - 1)); // true

// polyfill isSafeInteger()

if (!Number.isSafeInteger) {
  Number.isSafeInteger = function(num) {
    return Number.isInteger(num) &&
        Math.abs(num) <= Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
  };
}

// Special Values
// Certain values such as NAN and Infinity are not 32-bit safe

// Nonvalue values
// Undefined type value is undefined, null type value is null,
// we could say that null is an empty value and undefined is a missing value
// Null is a special keyword, not an identifier and thus you can not treat it as a variable
// to assign to, the undefnied is however an identifier ...

// Undefined
// in none strict-mode its actually possile to assign a value to the globally provided
// undefined identifier..

function foo() {
  undefined = 2; // bad idea
}

foo();

function foo() {
  "use strict"
  undefined = 2; // TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'undefined' of object '#<constructor>'
}



// in both strict and non strict mode however you can create a local variable of the name
// undefined, but again its a terrible idea:

function foo() {
  "use strict"
  var undefined = 2;
  console.log(undefined);
}
foo();

// void operator
// undefined is a bult int identifier thtaa holds the built in undefined value
// another way to get this value is the void operator

// The expression void -- "voids" out any value, so that the result of the
// expression is always the undefined value, ot doesnt modify the
// existing value, it just ensures that no value comes back from the expression:

var a = 42;
console.log(void a); // undefined
console.log(void a, a); // undefined 42

// Bu convention to represent the undefined value standalone by using void,
// youd use void 0, there is no practical difference between void 0, void 1 and Undefined

// But the void operator can be useful in a few other curcustances. If you need to ensure
// that an expression has ni result value, example:

function foo() {
  // note: APP.ready is provided by our application
  if (!APP.ready) {
    // try again later
    return void setTimeout(foo, 100);
  }
  var result;
  return result;
}

if (foo()) {
  // handle next task right away
  console.log("ready");
}




// Special Numbers
// The number type includes several special values.
// Any mathematical operation you perform without both operands being a number
// (or values that can be interpreted as regluar numbers in base 10/16 will result
// in the operation failing to produce a valud number, in which case you will get NaN value)
// Nan means "not a number", It easier to think of Nan as being an invalid number
// than to thnk of it as "not a number"

var a = 2 / "foo"; // valid
typeof a === "number" // true
console.log(a); // NaN

// in other words, "type not a number is a number" ..
// If you have a value in some variable and want to test to see if its this
// special failed number NaN, you might think you could directly compare to NaN
// itself, as you can with other values, like null or undefined, but nope..

var a = 2 / "foo";
console.log(a == NaN); // false
console.log(a === NaN); // false

// NaN is a very special value in that its never equal to another NaN value.
// Its the only value that is not reflexive, so:
console.log(NaN !== NaN) // true

// but this works:

var a = 2 / "foo";
console.log(isNaN(a)); // true

// but the isNan(..) utility has a fatal flaw, it appears it tried to take the
// meaning of NaN to literally, that its job is basically:
// "test if the thing passed in is either not a number or is a number"
// but thats not quite accurate

var a = 2 / "foo";
var b = "foo";

console.log(window.isNaN(a)); // true
console.log(window.isNaN(b)); // true

// As of ES6 a replacement utility has been provided: NUmber.isNan(..)
// A simple polyfill:

if (!Number.isNaN)  {
  Number.isNaN = function(n) {
    return (
      typeof n === "number" && window.isNaN( n )
    );
  };
}

var a = 2 /  "foo";
var b = "foo";

console.log(Number.isNaN(a)); // true
console.log(Number.isNaN(b)); // false



// We can implement NUmber.isNaN even easier by taking advantage of that peculiar fact that
// NaN isnt equal to itself. NaN is the only value in the language where thats true.

if(!Number.isNaN) {
  Number.isNaN = function(n) {
    return n !== n;
  };
}

// Infinities
// in Javascript it is possible to divide by zero, the operation is well-defined
// and reults in the value infinity, aka Number .POSITIVE_INFINITY

var a = 1 / 0;
var b = -1 / 0;

console.log(a); // Infinity
console.log(b); // -Infinity

// JS uses finite numeric representations IEEE 754 floating-point,
// so contrary to pure mathematics, it seems it is possible to overflow even with an
// operation like addition or subtraction, in which case youd get infinity / -infinity
// example:

var a = Number.MAX_VALUE; // 1.7976931348623157e+308
a + a; // Infinity    // infinity
a + Math.pow(2,970); // Infinity
a + Math.pow(2,969); // 1.7976931348623157e+308

// If an operation like addition results in a value thats too big to represent,
// the IEEE 754 "rount-to-nearest" mode specifies what the result should be.
// So in a crude sense NUMBER.MAX_VALUE + Math.pow(2,969) is closer to
// Number.MAX_VALUE than to infinity so it "rounds down", whereas Number.MAX_VALUE
// + Math.pow(2,970) is closer to infinity so it "rounds up".

// zero
// javascript has both a normal zero, 0  and a negative zero, -0
// Besides being specified literally as -+, negative zero also results from
// certain mathematic operations, example:

var a = 0 / -3 // -0
var b = 0 * -3 // -0

// Addition and subtraction cannot result in a negative zero.
// If you try to stringify -0 it will result in "0".

// Value vs Reference
// // In other laanguages values can either be assigned / passed by
// value-copy or by reference-copy depending on the syntax used.
// In js there are no pointers, annd references work a bit differentely.
// YOu cannot have reference from one js variable to another variable.

// A reference in js points at a shared value, so if you have 10 different
// references, they are all always distinct references to a single shared value
// none of them are references pointers to eachother ..
// Moreover in javascript there are no syntatic hints that control value versus
// reference assignent/passing. Instead the type of the value soleely controls
// whether that value will be assigned by value-copy or by reference-copy.

var a = 2;
var b = a; // b is always copy of the value a
b++;
console.log(a); // 2
console.log(b); // 3

var c = [1,2,3];
var d = c; // d is a reference to shared 1,2,3 value
d.push(4);

console.log(c); // (4) [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(d); // (4) [1, 2, 3, 4]

// siple values aka: scalar primitives are always assigned/passed by
// value-copy: null, undefined, string, nuber, boolean and ES6-symbol
// Copound values - objects, including arrays and all boxed object wrappers,
// and functions - always create a copy of the reference on assignment or passing.

// In the above snippet, because 2 is a scalar prmitve, a holds one inital copy
// of that value, and b is assigned another copy of the value.
// when changing b, you are in no way changing the value in a.

// But bothc and d are separate references to the same shared value 1,2,3,
// which is a compound value. Its important to note that neither c nor "owns"
// the 1,2,3 value - both are just equal peer references to the value. SO, when
// using either reference to the modify (.push(4)) the actual shared array value
// itself, its affecting just one shared valuee, and both references will reference
// the newly modified value 1,2,3,4

// Since references point to the value themselves an not to the variables,
// you cannot use one reference to change where another reference is pointed

var a = [1,2,3]
var b = a;
console.log(a); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(b); // [1, 2, 3]

b = [4,5,6];
console.log(a); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(b); // [4, 5, 6]

// when we make the assignent b = [4,5,6] we are doing absolutly nothing
// to affect where a is still referencing [1,2,3]. To do that, b would have to
// be a pointer to a, rahter than a reference to the array
//- but no such capability exists in js. The most common way such confusion happens
// is with function parameters:


function foo(x) {
  x.push(4);
  x; // 1,2,3,4

  x = [4,5,6];
  x.push(7);
  x; // [4,5,6,7]
}

var a = [1,2,3];

foo(a);
console.log(a); // [1,2,3,4] not [4,5,6,7]

// x.length = 0, and x.push(4,5,6,7) where not creating a new array
// but modifying the existing shared array, so of course, a references the new [4,5,6,7]
// contents.

// You cannot drectly control/override value-copy versus reference
// those semantics are controlled entirely by the type of the underlying value.

// To effectively pass a compound value (like an array) by the value-copy,
// you need to manually make a copy of it, so that the reference passed
// doesnt still poin to the original, example:

foo(a.slice());
// slice(..) with no parameters by default makes an entirely new (shallow) copy
// of the array, so we pass in a reference only to the copied array, and thus
// foo(..) cannot affect the contents of a

// To do the reverse - pass a scalar primitive value in a way where its value
// updates can be seen, kinda like a reference . you have to wrap the value in
// another compound value (object, array, etc) that can be passed by reference-copy:

function foo(wrapper) {
  wrapper.a = 42;
}

var obj = {
  a:2
}

foo(obj);
console.log(obj.a); // 42

// here obj acts as a wrapper for the scalar primitive property, 'a'.
// When passed to foo(..) a copy of the obj reference is passed in and set
// to the wrapper parameter- We now can use the wrapper reference to access
// the shared object, and update its property. After the function finishes, obj.a
// will see the updated value 42.
// It may occur to you that if you wanted to pass in a reference to a scalar
// prmitive value like 2, you could just box the value in its Nuber object
// wrapper. It is true a copy of the reference to this Number object will be
// passed to the function, but unfrtunatley, having a refence to the shared
// object is not going to give you the ability to modify the shared primitive
// value like you expect:

function foo(x) {
  x = x + 1;
  console.log(x); // 3
}


var a = 2;
var b = new Number(a);
foo(b);
console.log(b); // Number {[[PrimitiveValue]]: 2} (not 3)

// the problem is that the underlying scalar promitive value is not mutable
// (same for String and boolean). IF a Number object holds the scalar primitive
// value 2. that exact Number object can never be changed to hold another value;
// you can only create a whole new NUmber object with different value.




/*
  NATIVES
*/
/*
// most commonly used natives:
// String(), Number(), Boolean(), Array(), Object(), Function(), RegExp(),
// Date(), Error(), Symbol()

// if you are coming to JS from a language like Java, javascripts String()
// will look like the String(..) constructor youre ised tp for creating
// string values, so youll quickly observe that you can to things like:

var s = new String("Hello World");
console.log(s.toString()); // Hello World

// It is true that each of these natives can be used as a native constructor.
// But whats being constructed may be different than you think.

var a = new String("abc");
console.log(typeof a); // Object, not String
console.log(a instanceof String); // true - [object String]

// The result of the constructor form of value creation (new String("abc")) is
// an object wrapper around the primitivt ("abc") value.

// Internal [[Class]]
// Values that are typeof "object", such as an array are additionally tagged with
// an internal [[Class]] property. This property cannot be accessed directly, but
// can generally be revealed indirectly by borrowing the default Object.prototype.toString(..)
// method called against the value, example:

// Object.prototype.toString.call([1,2,3])
// "[object Array]"

// Object.prototype.toString.call(/regex-literal/i)
// "[object RegExp]"

// Note that there are no Null() or Undefined() native constructors, but nevertheless
// "Null" and "Undefined" are the internal [[CLass]] values exposed.

// But for other simple primitives like string, number and boolean, another
// behaviour actually kicks in, which is usually called "boxing"

console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call("abc")); // object string
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(42)); // Object number
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(true)); // Object Boolean

// Here each of the promitives are automatically boexed by their respective object wrappers
// which is why "String", "Number" and "Boolean" are revealed as the internal [[CLass]] values



var a = "abc";
var b = new String(a);
var c = Object(a);

console.log(a); // abc
console.log(b); // String {0: "a", 1: "b", 2: "c", length: 3, [[PrimitiveValue]]: "abc"}
console.log(c); // String {0: "a", 1: "b", 2: "c", length: 3, [[PrimitiveValue]]: "abc"}


// Unboxing
// I you have an object wrapper and want to get the underlying primitve value out
// you can use the valueOf method:

var a = new String("abc");
var b = new Number(42);
var c = new Boolean(true);


console.log(a.valueOf()); // abc
console.log(b.valueOf()); // 5
console.log(c.valueOf()); // true

// Unboxing can also happen implicitly, whe using an object wrapper value
// in a way that requires the primitive value.

var a = new String("abc");
var b = a + ""; // b has the unboxed primitive value "abc"

console.log(typeof a); // object
console.log(typeof b); // string


/*
  GRAMMAR
*/

// Statements & Expressions
// Statements are sentences, expressions are phrases, and operators are conjuctions/punnctuation
// Every epxression in js ca be evaluated down to a single specific value:
/*
var a = 3 * 6;
var b = a;

// Each of the three lines is a statement containing expressions, var a = 3 * 6
// and var b = a are called "declaration statements" because they each declare a variable
//(and optionally assigning it) The a = 3 * 6 and b = a assignments (minus the vars)
// are called assginement expressions.

// The third line contains just the expression b, but its also a statement,
// This is generally referred to as an "expression statement"


// ..
var b;
if(true) {
  b = 4 + 38;
}

//console.log(b); // 42

// 42 is the completion value of the if block, which took on the completion
// value of its last expression statement b = 4 + 38

// This kind of code doesnt work
/*
var a,b;

a = if(true) {
  b = 4 + 38;
}; // Unexpected token if


// We cant capture the completion value of a statement and assign it into
// another variable in an easy syntactic/grammatical way, at least not yet..
// so what can we do? We could use the much maligned evail(..) function to capture
// this completion value

var a,b;

a = eval ( "if (true) { b = 4 + 38; } ");
console.log(a); // 42

// Thsi is ugly though, there is a proposal for ES7 called "do expression"
*/
/*
var a,b;

a = do {
  if(true) {
    b = 4+38
  }
}; // Unexpected token do
 a; // 42

// The gerneral idea is to be able to treat statements as expressions - they
// can show up inside other statements - without needing to wrap them in an inline
// function expression and perform an explicit - return


// Expression Side Effects
// Most expressions dont have side-effects:
// the most common example of an expression with possible side effects is
// a function call expression

function foo() {
  a = a + 1;
}
var a = 1;
foo(); // undefined
console.log(a); // 2

var a = 42;
var b = a++;

console.log(a); // 43
console.log(b); // 42

// Its easy to mistakenly believe that b has value 43 just like a does.
// but confusion comes from not fully considering the when of the side effects
// of the ++ operator.
// The ++ operator and the -- decrement operator are both unary operators, which
// can be used in either a post-fix ("after") position or prefix ("before") position:


var a = 42;
a++; // 42
a; // 43

++a; // 44
a; // 44

// when used in the prefix position as ++a, its side effect (incrementing a)
// happens before the value is returned from the expression, rather than after
// as with a++

// it is soetimes mistakenly though that you can encapsulate the after side effect
// of a++ by wrapping it in a ( ) pair like:

var a = 42;
var b = (a++);

console.log(a); // 43
console.log(b); // 42


// ( ) itself doesnt define a new wrapped expression that would be evaluated
// after the after side effect of the a++ expression as we might have hoped.
// In fact even if it did a++ reurns 42 first, and unless you have another
// expression that reevluates a after the sde effect of ++, you are not going
// to get 43 from that expression, so b will not be assigned 43

// There is an option though, the ',' statement-series comma separator
// This operator allows you to string together multiple standalone expression statements
// into aa single statement

var a = 42, b;
b = ( a++, a);

console.log(a); // 43
console.log(b); // 43

// The ( ..) around a++ is required here. The reason is operator precedence.
// The expression 'a++,' means that the second 'a' statement expression gets
// evaluated after the after side effects of the a++ expression

// Another example of a side-effecting operator is 'delete'.
// Delete is used to remove a property from an object or a slot from an object or
// slot fro an array. But its usually just called as a stand-alone statement.


var obj = {
  a:42
};

console.log(obj.a); // 42
delete obj.a
console.log(obj.a); // undefined

// The result value of the delete operator is true if the requested operation
// is valid/allowable, or false otherwise. But the side effect of the operator
// is that it removes the property or array slot.

// One last example of a side-effecting operator, which may at once be both
// obvious and nonobvious, is the = assignment operator.
// example:

var a;
a = 42; // 42
b; // 42

// it may not seem like '=' in a = 42 is a side-effecting operator for the expression.
// But if we examine the result value of the a = 42 statement, its the value that
// was just asigned (42), so the assignment of the same value into a is essantially a side effect

// This behaviour that an assignment expression or expression, results
// in the assigned value is primarily useful for chained assignments such as:

var a,b,c;

a = b = c = 42;

// Here c = 42 is evaluated to 42, (with the side effect of assigning 42 to c)
// then b = 42 is evaluated to 42, (with the side effect of assigning 42 to b)
// and finally a = 42 is evaluted, (with the side effect of assigning 42 to a)

// Another scenario to consider:

function vowels(str) {
  var matches;

  if (str) {
    // pull out all the vowels
    matches = str.match( /[aeiou]/g);

    if (matches) {
      console.log(matches);
      return matches;
    }
  }
}


vowels("Hello world"); // ["e", "o", "o"]

// This works, but taking advantage of the assignment side-effect, we can
// simplify by combining the two if-statements into one :

function vowels(str) {
  var matches;

  // pull out all the vowels
  if (str && (matches = str.match( /[aeiou]/g ))) {
    console.log(matches);
    return matches;
  }
}

// the ( .. ) around 'matches = str.match..' is required, The reason is operator pecedence.
// there are quite few places in the javascript grammar rules where the same syntax
// means different things depending on where/hows its used.

// Curly braces
// Object literals
var a = {
  foo: bar()
}

// HOw do we know that this is an object literal? Because the { ... } pair
// is a value thats getting assigned to 'a'
// The 'a' reference is called "l-value" (aka left-hand value)
// since its the target of an assignment. The { ... } pair is an "r-value"
// (aka right-hand value) since its used just as a value (in this case as the source
// of the assignment)

// What happens if we remove the 'a =' part of the above snippet?
function bar() {}

{
  foo: bar();
}

// alot of developers assume that the { .. }  paris is just a standalone
// object literal that doesnt get assigned anywhere, but its actually different..

//Here { .. } is just a regular code block, its not very idiomatic in js to
// have a standalone { .. } block like that, but its perfectly valid js grammar.
// tt can be especially helpful when combined with let block--scoping declartions.

// The { ... } code block here is functionally pretty much identical to the code
// blockk being attached to some statement, like a for/while loop if conditional etc.

// but if its a normal block of code, whats that bizzarrre looking foo: bar() syntax
// and  how is it legal?

// Its because of a little known feature in javascript calleed  "labeled statements"
// foo is a label for the statement bar(), but whats the point of a labeled statement?

// IF javascript had a goto statement, youd theoretically be able to say goto foo and
// and have excecution jump to that location in code, gotos are usually considered terrible
// coding idioms as they make code much harder to understand ( aka spaghetti code )
// so its very good thing that javascript doesnt have a general goto

// However js does support a limited special form of goto, labeled jumps.
// Both the continue and break statements can optionally accept a specified label,
// in wwhich case the program flow "jumps" kind of like a goto. Consider:

// 'foo' labeled-loop

foo: for (var i=0; i<4; i++) {
  for (var j=0; j<4; j++) {
    // whatever the loops meet, continue outer-loop
    if (j == i) {
      // jump to the next iteration of the 'foo' labeled-loop
      continue foo;
    }
    // skip odd multiples
    if ((j * i)  % 2 == 1) {
      // normall (nonlabeled) continue  of inner loop
      continue;
    }
    console.log(i, j);
  }}

// 1 0
// 2 0
// 2 1
// 3 0
// 3 2

// continue foo does not ean "go to the foo labeled position to continue",
// but raher "continue the loop that is labeled foo with its next iteration"
// so its not really an arbitary goto.

// we skipped over the odd muliple 3 1 iteration, but the labeled-loop jump
// is with break __ from inside an inner loop where you want to brak out
// the outer loop. Without a labeled break, this same logic could sometimes
// be rather awkward to write:

// 'foo labeled-loop'
foo: for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  for (var j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
    if ((i * j) >= 3) {
      console.log("stopping:" ,i, j);
      break foo;
    }
    console.log(i, j);
  }
}

// 0 0
// 0 1
// 0 2
// 0 3
// 1 0
// 1 1
// 1 2
// stoping: 1 3

// break foo does not mean "go to the foo labeled position to continue" but rather
// "break out of the loop/block that is labeled foo and continue after it"
// Not exactly a goto in the traditional sense. ..

// the nonlabeled break alternative to the above should would probably need
// to involve one or more functions. shared scope variable access. etc
// It would not quite likely be more confusing than labeled break, so
// here using a labeled break perhaps the better option.

// A label can apply to nonloop block, but only break can reference such a nonloop label
// You can do a labeled break ___ out of any labeled block, but you cannot continue
// ___ a nonloop label nor can you do a nonlabeled break out of a block.

// 'bar' labeled block
function foo() {
  bar: {
    console.log("hello");
    break bar;
    console.log("never hit");
  }
  console.log("world");
}
foo();
// hello
// World

// labeled loopps/block are extremeley uncommon and often frowned upgon, its best
// to avoid them if possible. FOr example by using function calls instead of the loop jumps.

// its a very common beliefe that JSON is a proper subset of JS, so a string of JSON
// like  {"a": 42}  is though to be a valid Js, not true..
// Thats becaise statement labels cannot have quotes areound the, so 'a' is not a valid label.
// and thus ':' cannot come rÃ­ght after it

// one extremely common misconception along these lines is that if you were to load a js
// into a <script src=..> tag that only has JSON content in it (like fro an API call),
// the data would be read as vakud js but just be inaccessible to the program. JSON-P
// (tje practise of wrapping the JSOn data in a function call like foo({"a":42}))
// is usually said to solve this inaccessibility by sending the value to one of our
// programs functions, whch is not true.

// The totally valid JSON value {"a":42} by itself would actually throw a js error
// vecause itd be interreted as a stateent block wth an invalid label. But
// foo({"a":42}) is valid js because in it {"a":42} is an object literal value being
// passed to foo(..), so properly said, JSON-P akes JSON into a valid JS grammar.


// Blocks

console.log( [] + {} ); // [object Object]
console.log( {} + [] ); // [object Object]

// Object destructuring
// Starting wth ES6 another place that youll see {...} paris showing up is with
// "destructuring assignents", specifically object destructuring, example:

function getData() {
  // ..
  return {
    a: 42,
    b: "foo"
  };
}

var { a, b } = getData();
console.log( a, b ); // 42 "foo"
console.log(getData(a, b)); // {a: 42, b: "foo"}


// { a, b} = .. is a form of ES6 destructuring assignment, which is roughly
// equivalent to:

var res = getData()
var a = res.a;
var b = res.b;

console.log(a); // 42
console.log(b); // foo

// { a, b } is actually ES6 destructuring short hand for {a: a, b: b} so either work,

// Destructuring with a { .. } pair can also be used for named function arguments, which
// is sugar for this same sort of iplicit oject property assignent:


function player({ name, health, damage, inventory}) {
  // no need for :
  // var a = obj.a, b = obj.b, c = obj.c
  console.log( name, health, damage, inventory );
}

player( {
  name: "john",
  health: 100,
  damage: 0,
  inventory: ["key"]
}); // john 100 0 ["key"]

// So the context we use { .. } pairs in entirely determines what they mean,
// which illustrates the difference between syntax and grammar, its very important
// to understand these nuances to avoid unexpected interpretations by the js engine


// else if optional blocks
// its a common misconception that javascript has en else if clause, because
// you can do:

if(a) {
  // ..
}
else if (b) {
  // ..
}
else {
  // ..
}

// But there is a hidden characteristic of the js grammar here, there is
// no else if.. But if and else statements are allowed to omit the { }
// around their attached block if they only contain a single statement.


// if(a) domeSomething( a );
//Many js style guides will insist that you always use { } arund a single statement
// block like:

// if(a) { domeSomething( a ); }
// However the exact same grammar rule applies to the else clause, so the else if form
// yove likely always coded is actually parsed as:
a = true;
if (a)  {
  // ..
}
else {
  if (b) {
    // ..
  }
  else {
    // ..
  }
}



/*
  OPERATOR PRECEDEDENCE
*/

// javascripts version of %% and || are interesting in that they select and return one
// of their operands, rather than just resulting in true or false. Thats ease to reason
// about if there are only two operands and one operator:
/*
var a = 42;
var b = "foo";

console.log(a && b); // foo
console.log(a || b); // 42

// But what about when theres two operands involved and three opereands?
var a = 42;
var b = "foo";
var c = [1,2,3];

console.log(a && b || c); // foo
console.log(a || b && c); // 42

// To understand what those expressions result in we need to understand what rules
// govern how the operators are procesed.
// These rules are called "operator precedence"

// Recall the example from above :
var a = 42, b;
b = ( a++, a);

console.log(a); // 43
console.log(b); // 43

// But what happens if we reove the ( )  ?

var a = 42, b;
var b = a++, a;

console.log(a); // 43
console.log(b);  // 42

// why did did it change the value of b? Because the ',' operator has lower precedence
// than the '=' operator. So b = a++, a is interpreted as ( b = a++ ), a. Because
// a++ has after side effects, the asigned value to b is the value 42 before the ++ changes a

// its important to know that it actually has the lowest precedence.
// Every operator will more tightly bind than ',' will.
// again..
str = "hello world"
if (str && (matches = str.match( /[aeiou]/g ))) {
  console.log(matches); // ["e", "o", "o"]
}

// We said that the ( ) around the assignent is required, but why?
// because && has higher precedence than =, so without the ( ) to force the binding
// the expression would instead be treaded as (str && matches) = str.match..
// but this would be an error, because the result of (str && matches) isnt
// going to be a variable, but instead a value, (in this case undefined), and so
// it cannot be the lefthand side of an = assignent

// A more comlpex one..
var a = 42;
var b = "foo";
var c = false;
var d = d = a && b || c ? c || b ? a : c && b : a;
console.log(d); // 42

// the first question -- it at not even occured to ask does the first part
// ( a && b || c) behave like (a && b) || c or like a && (b || c)?

console.log( (false && true) || true) // true
console.log( (false && (true || true ))); // false Ã¤

// SO this is proof theyre different, but still how does false && true || behave
// The answer:

console.log( false && true || true ); // true
console.log( (false && true) || true ); // true

// So we have the answer, The && operator is evaluated first and the ||
// operator is evaluated second.
// but is that just because of left-to-right processing?
// Lets reverse the order of opereators.

console.log( true || false && false); // true
console.log( (true || false) && false); // false
console.log( true || (false && false)); // true

// now we have proved that && is evalutaed first and then ||, and in this case
// that was actually counter to generally expected left-to-right processing.

// So what caused the behaviour? Operator precedence
// Every language defines its own operator precedence list, its dismaying though,
// just how uncommon it is that js developers have read JS list.



// Short Circuited
// For both && and || operators, the righthand operand will not be evaluated if
// the lefthan operand is sufficient tot determine the outcode of the operation,
// Hence the name "short circuited" (in that if possible, it will take an early shortcut)
// Example with a && b, b is not evaluated if a is falsy, because the
// result of the && operand is already certain, so theres no pont in bothering
// to check b. Likewise  with a || b, if a is truy, the result of the operand
// is already certain, so theres n reason to check b.

//The short circuiting can be very helpful and is commonly used:

function doSomething(opts) {
  if (opts && opts.foo) {
      // ..
  }
}
// The opts part of the opts && opts.foo cool test acts as a sort of guard
// because if opts is unset (or otherwise not an object) the exressions opts.foo would
// throw an error The opts test failing plus the short circuiting means that opts.foo
// wont even be evaluated this no error .
// Simlilarly you can use || short circuiting

function doSomething(opts) {
  if (opts.cache || primeCache()) {
    // ..
  }
}
// here we are checking for opts.cache first and if its present we dont call
// the primeCache() function thus avoiding potentially unnecessary work.


// Using variables too early
// ES6 defines a new concept called TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone)
// The TDZ refers to places in code where a variable reference cannot yet be
// because it hasnt reached it required initialization

// The most clear example of this is with ES6 let-block scoping

{
  a = 2; // a is not defined
  let a;
}


// The assignment a = 2 accessing the a variable (which is indeed block-coped to
// the { ... } block) before its been initialized by the let a declaration so its in the
// TDZZ for a and throws an error.

// Interestingly, while typeof  has an exception to be safe for undeclared  variables
// no such safety exception is made for TDZ references.

{
  console.log(typeof a); // undefined
  console.log(typeof b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined (TDZ)
  let b;
}
*/

/*
  FUNCTION ARGUMENTS
*/
/*

// Another example of a TDZ violation can be seen with ES6 default parameter values

let b = 3;
function foo( a = 42, b = a + b + 5 ) {
  //..
}
console.log(foo()); //ReferenceError: b is not defined


// The b reference in the assignment would happen in the TDZ for the parameter
// b, (not pull in the outer b reference) so it will throw an error.
// However the 'a' is fine since by that time its past the tdz for parameter 'a'

// When  using ES6s default parameter values, the default value is applied
// to the paraeter if you either omit an argument or you pass an undefined
// value in its place

function foo( a = 42, b = a + 1) {
  console.log(a,b);
}
foo();  // 42 43
foo(undefined); // 42 43
foo(5); // 5 6
foo(void 0, 7); // 42 7
foo(null); // null 1

// here null is coerced to a '0' value in the a+1 expression.
// Fro the ES6 default paraeter values perspective, theres no difference between
// omitting an an argument and passing an undefined value. However there is away to
// detect the difference in some cases:

function foo( a = 42, b = a + 1) {
  console.log(arguments.length, a, b,
    arguments[0], arguments[1]
            );
}
foo(); // 0 42 43
foo(10); // 1 10 11 10 undefined
foo(10, undefined); // 2 10 11 10
foo(10, null); // 2 10 null 10 null

// Even though the default parameter values are applied to the a and b
// parameters, if no arguments were passed in those slots, the arguments array
// will not hae entries.


//Conversely if you pass an undefined argument explicitly an entry
//will exist in the arguments array for that argument, but will be undefined
// and not the (necessarily) same as the default value that was applied
// to the named parameter for that slot

// While ES6 default parameter values can create divergence between the arguments array
// slot and the correspongind named parmeter variable, this same disjointness can
// also occur in tricky ways in ES5 :

function foo(a) {
  a:42;
  console.log(arguments[0]);
}
foo(2); // 2 (in ES6?) 42 in ES5
foo(); // undefined  (not linked)

// if you pass an argument slot and the named parameter are linked to always have
// the same value. If you omit the argument, no such linkage occurs
// But in strict mode linkage doesnt exist regarless

function foo(a) {
  "use strict";
  a = 42;
  console.log(arguments[0]);
}

foo(2); // 2
foo(undefined); // undefined (not linked)

// Its almost certainly a bad idea to ever rely on any such linkage,
// and infact the linkage itself is a leaky abstraction thats exposing an underlying
// implementation detail of the engine, rather than a properly designed feature

// Use of the arguments array has beed deprecated (especially in favor of ES6.. rest parameters)
// Prior to ES6 , arguments is the only way to get an array of all passed
// arguments to pass along to other functions. You can also mix named parameters
// with the argumetns array and be safe, as long as you  follow one simple rule,
// never refer to a named aparameter and its corresponding arguments slot at the same time.
// then youll never expose the leaky linkage behaviour:
function foo(a) {
  console.log( a + arguments[1]); // safe
}
foo( 10, 12 ); // 22


// Try.. Finally
// The code in finally clause always runs and it always runs right after the try
// (and catch if present) finish, before any other code runs. In one sense, you can
// kind of think of the code in a finally clause as being in a callback function that
// will always be called regardless of how the rest of the block behaves.

// SO what happens if there a return statement inside a try clause?
// it obviously will return a value, right? But does the calling code that
// receives that value run before or after the finally?
function foo() {
  try {
    return 42;
  }
  finally {
    console.log("inside finally");
  }
  console.log("never runs");
}
console.log(foo()); // Inside finally 42

// The return 42 runs right away, which sets up the completion value
// from the foo() call, this action completes the try clause and the finally
// clause immediately runs next. Only then is the foo() function complete, so
//  that its copletion value is returned back for the console.log() statement use.

// Now if an exception is thrown inside a finally clause, it will override as the
// primary completion of that function. If a previous return in the try block had set
// a complettion value for the function, that value will be abandoned:

function foo() {
  try {
    return 42;
  }
  finally {
    throw "Oops"
  }
  console.log("never runs");
}
console.log(foo()); // Uncaught Oops


// It shouldnt be surprising that other control statements like continue
// andd break exhibit similiar behaviour to return and throw:

for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  try {
    continue;
  }
  finally {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
// 0123456789

// the console.log(i) stateent runs at the end of the loop iteration
// which is caused by the continue statementm however it still runs before
// the i++ iteration update statement, which is why the values printed are 0..9
// instead of 1..10

// ES6 adds a yield statement, in generator which in some ways can be seen as
// intermediate return statement. However, unlike a return, a yield isnt
// complete until the generator is resumed, whivh eans  a try {.. yield } has
// not completed. So an attached finally clause will not run right after the
// yield as it does with return

function foo() {
  try {
    return 42;
  }
  finally {
    // no return here so no override
  }
}

function bar() {
  try {
    return 42;
  }
  finally {
    // override  previous 'return 42'
    return;
  }
}

function baz() {
  try  {
    return 42;
  }
  finally {
    // override previous 'return 42'
    return "inside finally";
  }
}
console.log(foo()); // 42
console.log(bar()); // undefined
console.log(baz()); // inside finally


// onrmally the omission of return in a function is the same as return; or even
// return undefined; but inside a finally block the omission of return does not
// act like an overriding return undefined; it just lets the previous return stand

// we can combine  finally with labeled break: (dont do this ...)


function foo() {
  bar: {
    try {
      return 42;
    }
    finally {
      break bar;
    }
  }
  console.log("hello")
  return "world";
}
console.log(foo()); // heloo world


// Switch
var a = undefined;

switch (a) {
  case 2:
      console.log("case 2");
    break;
  case 42:
    console.log("case 42");
  break;
  default:
  console.log("default");
}
// default

var a = 42;

switch (true) {
  case a == 10:
        console.log("10 or '10'");
        break;
  case a == 42:
        console.log("42 or '42'");
        break;
  default:
        console.log("default");
}
// 42 or '42'

// Thsi works because the case clause can have any expression which means it will
// strictly match that expressions result to the test expression (True)
// since a == 42 results in true here, the match is made.

// Despite ==, the switch matching itself is still strict, between true
// and true here. If the case expression resulted in something that was
// truthy but not strictly true, it wouldnt work. This can bite you if youre
// for instance using a "logical operator" like || or && in your expression.

var a = "hello world";
var b = 10;

switch (true) {
  case (a || b == 10):
    console.log(10);
    break;
  default:
  console.log("default");
}
// default since the result of (a || b == 10) is "hello world" and not true the
// strict match fails. In this case, the fix is to force the expression
// explicitly to be true or false, such case !!(a || b == 10):

// lastly the default clause is optional, and t doesnt necessarily have to come at
// the end, (althought thats the strong convention) Even in the default
// clause, the same rules apply about encountering a break or not:

var a = 10;

 switch (a) {
   case 1:
   case 2:
        // never gets here
   default:
        console.log("default");
   case 3:
        console.log("3");
        break;
 } // default 3

 // The way this snippet processes is that it passes through all the case clause
// matching first, finds no match, then goes back up to the default clause and starts
// executing, Since theres no break there, it continues executing in the already skipped
// over case: 3 block befoore stopping once it hits that break.

// While this sort of roundabout logic is clearly possible in js theres almost no
// chance that its going to make for reasonable or understandable code...




// Host Objects

// The well covered rules for how variables behave in JS have expetions to them
// when it comes to variables that are auto-defined, or otherwise created
// and provided to JS by the enviroment that hosts your code, (brower etc)
// - so called host-objects, which include both built-in objects and functions.
// For example:

var a = document.createElement("div");
console.log(typeof a); // object
console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(a)); // [object HTMLDivElement]
console.log(a.tagName); // DIV

// 'a' is not just an object, but a special host object because its a DOM element.
// It has a different internal [[CLASS]] value ("HTMLDivElement") and comes
// with predefined and often unchangable properties.



// <script>s
var greetings = "hello world";
var el = document.createElement( "script" );
el.text = "function foo() {alert(greetings);} setTimeout(foo, 1000); ";
document.body.appendChild(el);




// A program in chunks
// you may write your js program in one .js file, but your program is
// almost certainly  comprised of several chunks, only one which is
// going to execute now, and the rest of which will execute later. The most
// common unit of each chunk is the function.

// The problem js developers new to js seem t have is that later doesnt happen
// strictly after now. In other words tasks that cannot complete now are, by
// defenition going to complete asynchronously, and thus we wiÃ¶lÃ¶ not have
// blocking behaviour.
// Consider:

// ajax(...) is soe arbitrary ajax function given by a library
// var data = ajax("http://exapmple.data.txt");

// standard Aajax requestst dont complete synchronously which means the ajax(..)
// function does not yet have any value to return back to be assigned to the data
// variable. If ajax(..) could block until the response came back, then the
//  data = assignment would work fine.

// The simplest way of "waiting" from now until alater is to use a function, commonly
// called callback-function:

// ajax("http://some.url.1, function callback(data) {
//  console.log(data);
//});

// Async Console

// There is no specification  or set of requrements around how the console.* methods work,
// they are not offically part of javascript, but are instead added to js by the
// 'hosting enviroment'.. So different browsers and js enviroments do as they please,
// which can sometimes lead to confusing behaviour.
// in particular there are som browsers and some conditions that console.log(..)
// does not actually immediately ouput what its guven. The main reasnon this happen
// is because I/O is a very slow and blocking part of many programs not just JS.
// So it may perform better from thye page / UI perspecitve for a browser to handle
// console I/O asynchronously in the background, without you parhaps even knowing
// that it occurred. A not terrible common but possible scenario where this could be
// observable (not from code itself but from the outside)

var a = {
  index: 1
};

// later
console.log(a);  // { index: 1 }

// even later
a.index ++;

// weÂ´d normally expect to see the a object be snapshotted at the exact moment
// of the console.log(); statement, printing something like { index: 1 } such that
// in the next statement when a.index++ happens, its modifying something different
// than or just strictly after the output of 'a'

// Most of the time, thre preceding code will probably produce an object
// representation in your developer tools console thats what you expect.
// But its possible this same code could run in a situation where thje browser
// felt it needed to defer the console I/O to the background,, in which case
// its possible that by the time the object is represented in the browesers console,
// the a.index++ has already ahppened, and it shows { index: 2 }

// Its a moving target under what condidionts exactly console I/O will be deferred, or
// even whether itr will be observable. Just be aware of this possible asynchronicity
// in I/O in case y ou ever run into issues debugging where objects have been
// modified after the console.log(..); statement an yet you see the unexpected modifications .

// If you run into this scenario the best option is to use breakpoints in your JS debugger,
// instead of relying on the console output. The best option would be to force a "snapshot"
// of the object in question by serializing it to a string, like with JSON.stringify(..)


// Event loop
// javascript itself actually never had any direct notiion of asynchrony built into it.
// The JS engine itself never done anything more  than ececute a sinle chunk of your
// program at any given moment, when asked to.

// The JSs engine doesnt run in isolation, it runs inside a hosting-enviroment
// which is for most developers the typical web browser.
// Js over the last several years has expanded beyound the browser into other
// enviroments, such as servers via node.js

// But the common "thrad" of all these enviroments is that they have mechanism
// in them that handles executing multiple chins of your program over time, at
// each moment invoking the js engine, called "event loop".

// in other words the js engine has had no innate sense of time, but has instead been
// an on-demand execution enviroment for any arbitary snippet of JS. Its the
// surrounding enviroment that has always scheduled "events" (js code executions)

// So for example when your js program makes an Ajax request to fetch some data from
// a server, you set up the respoonse code in a callback function. The browser is then
// setup to listen for the response from the network, when it has something to give you
// it schedules the call-back function to be executed by inserting it into the event-loop.

// So whats the event loop?
// lets conceptuialize this with fake-code

// "eventloop" is an array that acts as a queue
// first-in, first-out
var eventLoop = [];
var event;

// keep going forever
while (true) {
  // perform a "tick"
  if (eventLoop.length > 0) {
    // get the next event in the queue
    event = eventLoop.shift();
    // now, execute the next event
    try {
      event();
    } catch (error) {
      reportError(error);
    }
  }
}

// Theres a continously running loop represented by the while loop, and eact
// iteration of this loop is called a "tick". For each tick , if an event is  waiting
// on the queue, its taken off and executed. These events are your function callbacks.

// Its important to note that the setTimeout() doesnt put your call-bacck on the
// event loop queue. What it does is set up a timer; when the timer expires,
// the enviroment places your callback into the event loop, such that some future tick
// will pick it up and execute it.

// So in other words your program is generally broken up into lots of small chunks
// which happen one after the other in the event loop queue. And technically
// oiher events not related directly to your program can be interleaved within
// the queue as well.

// ES6 specifies exactly how the event loop works, thich means technically its
// within the purview of the js engine, rather than just the hosting enviroment.
// One main reason for this change is the introduction of ES6 Promises, because
// they require the ability  to have direct, finegrained control over
// scheduling operations on the event loop queue.


// Paralell Threading
// Its very common to conflate the term "async" and "paralell" but they are
// actually quite different. Asynch is abou the gap between now and later.
// But paralell is about things being able to occur simultaneously.

// The most common tools for parallel computing are processes and threads.
// Processes and threads execute independently and may execute simultaneously: on
// separate processors, or even separate computers, but multiple and serialism can coexist
// in the form of cooperating event loops in separate threads.

// The interleaveing of parallel threads of execution and the interleaving of
// of asynchronous events occur at very different levels of granularity.
// example:

function later() {
  answer = answer * 2;
  console.log("meaning of life: ", answer);
}

  // while the entire contents of later() would be regarded as a single
  // event loop queue entry, when thinking about a thread this code would run on
  // theres actually perhaps dozen different low-level operations. For exampple
  // answer = answer * 2 reuires first loading the current value of answer, then
  // putting 2 somewhere, then performing the multiplication, then taking the
  // result and storing it back into answer.

  // In a single threaded enviroment, it really doesnt matter that the items
  // in the thread queue are low-level operations, because noothing can interup
  // the thread. But if you have a parallel system, where two different threads
  // are operating in the same program, you could very likely have unpredictable behaviour.
  // COnsider:

  var a = 20;

  function foo() {
    a = a + 1;
  }

 function bar() {
   a = a * 2;
 }
 // ajax(..) in some arbitrary ajax function given by a lib
 ajax("http://www.example.com", foo);
 ajax("http://www.example.com", bar);

 // in javascripts single threaded behaviour, if foo() runs before bar()
 // the result is that a has 42, but if bar() runs before foo() the result in a
 // will be 41.

 // If js events sharing the same data executed in paralell, though the problems
 // would be much more subtle. COnsider these twi lists of pseudocode tasks as the
 // thread that could respectively run the code in foo() and bar(), and consider
 // what happens if they are running at exactly the same time.

 // Thread 1 (X and Y are temprary memory allocations)
foo():
a. load value of 'a' in 'X'
b. store '1' in 'Y'
c. add 'X' and 'Y', store result in 'X'
d. store value of 'X' in 'a'

// Thread 2 (X and Y are temporary memory allocations)
bar():
a. load value of 'a' in 'X'
b. store '2' in Y
c. multiply 'X' and 'Y', store result in 'X'
d. store value of 'X' in 'a'

// NOw lets say that the two threads are running truly in porallel. You
// can probably spot the problem. They use shared memory locations of X and Y for
// their temporary steps.

// So threaded programming is very tricky because if you dont take special steps
// to prevent this kind of interruption/interleaving from happening, youi can get
// very surprising, nondeterministic behaviour.

 // Javascript never shares data across threads, which means that level of nondeterministic
 // isnt a concern. But that doesnt mean js is always deterministic.
 // The relative ordering of foo() and bar() produces two different results (41, 42)


 // Run to completion
// because of javascripts single-threading, the code from inside of foo(), and bar()
// is atomic, which means that once foo() starts running, the entirety of its code
// will finish before any of the code in bar() can run, or vice versa.
// This is called run-to-completion behaviour.
// In fact the run-to-completion semantics are much more obvious when foo() and bar()
// have more code in them, such as:

var a = 1;
var b = 1;

function foo() {
  a++;
  b = b * a;
  a = b + 3;
}

function bar() {
  b--;
  a = 8 + b;
  b = a * 2;
}

// ajax(..) in some arbitrary ajax function given by a lib
//ajax("http://www.example.com", foo);
//ajax("http://www.example.com", bar);

// because foo() cannot be interrupted by bar(), and bar() cant be interrupted
// by foo(), this program has only two possible outcomes depending on which
//starts running first, if threading were present, and the individual statements
// foo() and bar() could be interleaved, the number of possible outcomes would
// be greatly increased.

// Chunk 1 is synchronous (happens now), but chunks 2 and 3 are asynchronous
// (happens later), which means their execution will be separated by a gap of time

// Chunk 1:
var a = 1;
var b = 1;

// Chunk 2:
a++;
b = b * a;
a = b + 3;

// Chunk 3 (bar()):
b--;
a = 8 + b;
b = a * 2;

// Chunks 2 and 3 may happen in either the first-order, so there are two possible
// outcomes for this program, as illustrated here:

// Outcome 1:

var a = 1;
var b = 2;

// foo()
a++;
b = b * a;
a = b + 3;

// bar()
b--;
a = 8 + b;
b = a * 2;

// Outcome 2:

var a = 1;
var b = 2;

// bar()
b--;
a = 8 + b;
b = a * 2;

// foo()
a++;
b = b * a;
a = b + 3;

console.log(a); // 183
console.log(b); // 180

// Two outcomes from the same code means we still have a nondeterminism.
// But its at the function (event) ordering level, rather then at the statement
// ordering level, as it is with threads. In other words, its more
// deterministic than threads would have been.


// Conccurrency
// Lets imagine a site that displays a list of status updates, that progressively
// loads as the users scrolls down the list. To make such a feature work
// correctly (at least) two separate "processes" will need to be executinjg simultaneously.
// The first "process" will respond to onscroll events (makin ajax requests from new content)
// as they fire the user has scrolled the page further down. The second "process" will
// recieve Ajax responses back to render onto the page.
// Conccurrency is when two or more "processes" are executing simultaneously over
// the same period, regardless of whether their individual constituent operations
// happen in parallel. You can think of conccurrency then as "process"-level (or task-level)
// parallelism, as opposed to operation level parallelism.
// For a given window of time, lets visualize each independent "process" as a
// of events/operations:

// Process 1 (onscroll events):
onscroll, request 1
onscroll, request 2
onscroll, request 3
onscroll, request 4
onscroll, request 5

// Process 2 (ajax response events)
response 1
response 2
response 3
response 4
response 5

// Its quite possible that an onscroll event and an ajax event response event
// could be ready to be processed at exactly the same moment, for example lets visualize
// these events in a timeline.

onscroll, request 1
onscroll, request 2 response 1
onscroll, request 3 response 2
response 3
onscroll, request 4
onscroll, request 5
onscroll, request 6  response 4
onscroll, request 7


// But going back to our notion of the event loop. JS can handle only one event
// at a time, so either onscroll, request 2 is going to happen first or response 1
// is going ti happen first, but they cannot happen at literally the same moment.

// Lets visualize the interleaving of all these events onto the event loop queue:

onscroll, request 1 <--- process 1 starts
onscroll, request 2
respoonse 1         <--- process 2 starts
onscroll, request 3
response 2
response 3
onscroll, request 4
onscroll, request 5
onscroll, request 6
reponse 4
onscroll, request 7  <--- process 1 finishes
response 6
response 5
response 7           <--- process 2 finishes

// Process 1 and process 2 run concurrently (task-level parallel),
// but their individual events run sequentially on the event loop queue.
// By the way, notice how reponse 6 and response 5 came back out of expected order?
// The single-threaded event loop is one expression of concurrency.



// Noninteracting
// As two or more "processes" are interleaving their steps/events concurrently
// within the same program, they dont necessarily need to interact with each other
// if the tasks are unrelated. If they dont interact, nondeterminism is perfectly
// accceptable. For example:

var res = {}

function foo(results) {
  res.foo = results;
}

function bar(results) {
  res.bar = results;
}

// ajax(...) is somee arbitrary ajax function given by a library
//ajax("http://exapmple.data.txt", foo);
//ajax("http://exapmple.data.txt", bar);

// The concurrent  "processes" are the two repsonse() calls that will be
// made to handle the Ajax responses.
// Lets assume the expected behaviour is thtat res[0] has the results of the
// http call, and res[1] has the results of the second http call. Sometimes
// that will be the case, but sometimes theyll be flipped, depengind on which
// call finishes first. Theres pretty good likelihood that this nondeterminism is
// race condition bug.

// So, to address such a race condition, you can coordinate ordering interaction:

var res = [];

function response(data) {
  if (data.url == "http://example.data.txt") {
    res[0] = data;
  }
  else if (data.url == "http://example.data2.txt"){
    res[1] = data;
  }
}

//ajax("http://example.data.txt", foo);
//ajax("http://exapmple.data2.txt", bar);

// regardless of which ajax response comes back first, we inspect the data.url
// to figure out which position the response data should occupy in the res array.
// res[0] will always hold the "http://http://example.data.txt" results, and
// res[1] will always hold the "http://http://example.data2.txt" results.
// Through simple coordination, we eliminated the race condition nondeterminism.

// The same reasoning from this scenario would apply if multiple concurrent function
// calls were interacting with each other through the shared DOMm like one updating
// the contents of a <div> and the other updating the style or attributes of the <div>
// You probably wouldnt want to show the DOM element before it had content, so the
// coordination must ensure proper ordering interaction. Consier:

var a, b;

function foo(x) {
  a = x * 2;
  baz();
}

function bar(y) {
  b = y * 2;
  baz();
}

function baz() {
  console.log(a + b);
}

// ajax(...) is somee arbitrary ajax function given by a library
//ajax("http://exapmple.data.txt", foo);
//ajax("http://exapmple.data2.txt", bar);


// In this example, wheter foo() or bar() fires first, it will always  cause baz()
// to run too early (either a or b will still be undefined) but the second
// invocation of baz() will work, as both a and b will be available.

// There are different ways to address such a condition. Heres on simple way:

var a, b;

function foo(x) {
  a = x * 2;
  if (a && b) {
    baz();
  }
}

function bar(y) {
  b = y * 2;
  if (a && b) {
    baz();
  }
}

function baz() {
  console.log( a + b);
}

//ajax("http://exapmple.data.txt", foo);
//ajax("http://exapmple.data2.txt", bar);

// the if (a && b) conditional around the baz() call is traditionally called a "gate"
// because we're not sure sure what order a and b will arrive, but we wait for
// both of them to get there before we proceed to open the gate call baz()

// Another conccurrency interaction condition yuou may rau into is sometimes
// called a race, but more correctly called a "latch". It's characterized by
// "only first one wins" behaviour. Here nondeterminism is acceptable, in that
// you are explicitly saying its OK for the "race" to finish line to to have
// only one winner. Conciser this broken code:

var a;

function foo(x) {
  a = x * 2;
  baz();
}

function bar(x) {
  a = x / 2;
  baz();
}

function baz() {
  console.log( a );
}

// ajax("http://exapmple.data.txt", foo);
// ajax("http://exapmple.data2.txt", bar);

// Whichever one foo() or bar() fires last will not only overwrite the assigned
// 'a' value from the other, but it will also duplicate the call to baz().

// So we can coordinate the interaction with a simple "latch", to let only the first
// one through. Example:

var a;

function foo(x) {
  if (!a) {
    a = x * 2;
    baz();
  }
}

function bar(y) {
  if (!a) {
    a = x / 2;
    baz();
  }
}

function baz() {
  console.log( a );
}

// ajax("http://exapmple.data.txt", foo);
// ajax("http://exapmple.data2.txt", bar);

// the if (!a) conditional allows only the first foo() or bar() through, and
// the second calls would just be ignored.


// Cooperation

// Another expresion of concurrency coordination is called cooperative concurrency.
// Here the focus isnt no much on interacting via value sharing in scopes. The
// goal is to take a long-running "process" and break it up into stes or batches
// so that other concurrent "processes" have achange to interleave their operations
// into the event loop queue.

// For example consiser an Ajax response handler that needs to run through a long
// list of results to transform the values. We'll use Array#map(..) to keep the
// code shorter:

// function 'response(...)' receives array of results from the ajax call
function response(data) {
  // add onto existing 'res' array
  res = res.concat(
    // make new transformed array with all 'data' values doubled
    data.map( function(val){
      return val * 2;
    })
  );
}
// ajax("http://exapmple.data.txt", response);
// ajax("http://exapmple.data2.txt", response);

// if "http://exapmple.data.txt" gets its results back first, the entire list
// will be mapped into res all at once. If its a few thousand or less records,
// this is not generally a big deal. But if its like 10 million records,
// that can take a while to run. (several seconds)

// while such a "process" is running, nothing else in the page can happen, including
// no other reponse(..) calls, no UI updates, not even user events like scrolling,
// typing, button clicking and the like. THats pretty bad.

// So, to make a more cooeratively concurrent system, one thats friendlier and doesnt
// hog the event loop queue, you can process these results in asynchronous batches,
// after each one yielding back to the event loop to let other waiting events happen.

// Here is a simple approach:

var res = [];
// reponse (..) recieves array of results from the ajax call

function response(data) {
  var chunk = data.splice( 0, 1000 );

  // add onto existing 'res' array
  res = res.concat(
    // make a new transofmred array with all 'chunk' values doubled
    chunk.map(function(val) {
      return val * 2;
    })
  );
  if (data.length > 0) {
    // asynch schedule next batch
    setTimeout( function(){
      response(data);
    }, 0 );
  }
}
// ajax("http://exapmple.data.txt", response);
// ajax("http://exapmple.data2.txt", response);

// we process the data set in maximum-sized chunks of 1000 items.
// By doing so, we ensure a short-running "process", even if that
// means many more subsequent "processes", as the interleaving (performant) site/app.

// We use the setTimeout(.. 0) (hack) for asynch scheduling which basically
// just means "stick this function at the end of the current event loop queue".


// Jobs
// As of ES6 theres a new concept layered on top of the event loop queue called
// "job queue". The most likely exposure youll have to it is with the asynchronous
// behaviour of Promises.
// unfortunately, at the moment its a mechanism without an exposed API, and thus
// demonstrating it is a bit more convouluted. So we're going to descripte it
// conceptually.

// The job queue is a queue hanging off the end of every tick in the event loop
// queue. Certain asynch -implied actions that may occur during a tick of the
// event loop will not cause a while new event tot be added to the event loop queue,
// but will instead add an item (aka Job) to the end of the current tick's job queue.
// A job can also cause more jobs to be added to the end of the same queue.
// So its theoretically possible that a job lool could spin indefinetely, thus
// starving the program of the ability to move on to the next event loop tick.
// This  would conceptually be almost the same as just expresing a lonog-runing
// or infinite loop. Jobs are kind of like the spirit of the setTimeout(..0) hack,
// but implemented in such a way as to have a much more  well-defined and
// guaranteed ordering: later, but as soon as possible.
// Lets imagine an API for scheduling jobs, consider:



console.log( "A" );
setTimeout( function() {
  console.log( "B" );
}, 0);

// theoretical "Job API"
schedule( function() {
  console.log( "C" );

  schedule( function() {
    console.log( "D" );
  });
});

// You might expect this to print out A B C D, but instead it would print out
// A C B D, because the jobs happen at the end of the current event loop tick,
// and the timer fires to schedule for the next event loop tick (if available)


// Statement ordering
// The order in which we express statements in our code is not neceearily the same
// order as the js engine will execute them, That may seem like quite strange assertion
// to make, so well just brefly explore it. Consider:
var a, b;
a = 10;
b = 30;
a = a + 1;
b = b + 1;

console.log(a + b); // 42

// This code has no expressed asynchrony to it,
// (other than the rare console asynch I/O dicussed earlier) so the most likely assumption
// is that it would process line by line in top down fashion.

// But its possible that the js engine, after compiling this code might find
// opportunities to run code faster by rearraging (safely) the order of these
// statements. Essentially, as long as you cant observe the reordering anythinmgs fair game.
//For example, the engine might find its faster to actually execute the code like this:

var a, b,
a = 10;
a++;
b = 30;
b++;

console.log( a + b );  // 42


// or this:

var a, b;
a = 11;
b = 31;
console.log( a + b ); // 42

// or even:

// because 'a' and 'b' arent used anymore, we can inline and dont even need thems
console.log( 42 ); // 42

// In all these cases the js engine isperforming safe optimizations during
// its compilation, as the end observable result will be the same.
// But here's a scenario where the specific optimizations would be unsafe and thus
// couldnt be allowed (of course not to sat that its not optimized at all)

var a, b;
a = 10;
b = 30;

// we neex 'a' and 'b' in their preincrementet state!
console.log( a * b); // 300

a = a + 1;
b = b + 1;

// Other console.log( a + b); // 42
// Other examples  where the compiler reordering could create observable side
// effects (and thuis must be dissalowed) would include things like any function  call
// with side effects, (even and especially getter functions) or ES6 proxy objects.
// Consider:

function foo() {
  console.log(b);
  return 1;
}

var a, b, c;

c = {
  get bar() {
    console.log( a );
    return 1;
  }
};

a = 10;
b = 30;

console.log(a += foo()); // 30
console.log(b += c.bar);  // 11
console.log( a + b ); // 42

// if it weerent for the console.log(..); statements in this snippet
// the js engine would likely have been free, if it wanted to, to  reorder the code
// like this:

// ...
a = 10 + foo();
b = 30 + c.bar;

// ..


/*
  CALLBACKS
*/

// Countless JS programs even every sophistricated and complex ones, have
// been written upon no other async foundation than the callback (with, of course
// the concurrency interaction patterns we explored ealier.) The callback function
// is the asynch workhorse for Javascript, and it does its job respectably.

// Except.. calÃ¶lbacks are not without their shortcommings. Many delopers
// are excited by the promise of better async patterns. But its impossible to effectively
//use any abstraction if you dont understand its abstracting, and why.

// Continuations
// lets go back to the async callback example we started with in chapter 1,
// but let me slighly modify it to illustrate a point:

//   A
//   ajax( ".. " function(...) {
//  C
// });
// B

// A // B represent the first half of the program aka the "now",
// and // C marks the second half of the program aka the "later".
// The first half executes right away, and then theres a pause if indeterminate
// lenght. At some future moment, if the Ajax call coompletes, then the program
// will pick up where it left off, and continue with the second half.

// In other words, the callback function wraps or encapsulates the continuation
// of the program. Lets make the code even simple:
/*


// A
setTimeout(function(){
  // C
}, 1000);
// B



// Nested/Chained Callbacks
// Consider:
listen( "click", function handler(evt) {
  setTimeout( function request() {
    ajax( "http://someurl.1", function response(text) {
      if (text == "hello") {
        handler();
      }
      else if (text == "world") {
        request();
      }
    });
  }, 500);
});

// There a good chance code like that is recognizable to you. We've got
// a chain of three functions nested togheter, each one representing a step in
// an asynchronous series, tasks/"process".

// This kind of code is often callbed "callback hell", and sometimes also referred
// to as the "pyramid of doom".

// But callback hell actually has almost nothing to do with thenesting/indentation.
// Ots far deeper problem than that. We'll show how and why as we continue through
// the rest of this chapter.

// First we're waiting for the click event, then we're wwainting for the
// timer to fire, then we're waiting for hte ajax response to come back,
// at which point it might do it all again.

// at a first glance this code may seem to map its asynchrony naturally to sequential
// brain planning.

// First (now)
listen("..", function handler() {
  // ..
});

// Then "later"

setTimeout( function request(){
  // ..
}, 500);

// Then still later:
ajax("..", function response() {
  // ..
});

// And finally (most later)

if () {
  // ...
}
else {

}


// But theres several problems with reasoning about this code linerly in
// such a fashion.
// Forst, its an accident of the eexample that our step are on subsequent lines
// ( 1,2,3 and 4 ..) in real async JS progra,s, theres often alot more noise
// cluttering things up, noise that we have to deftly maneuver past in our brains
// as we jump from  one function to the next. Understanding the asynch flow
// in such callback-laden code is not impossible, but its certainly fnot natural
// or easy, even with lots of practiuse.

// But alose, theres something deeper wrong, which isnt evident just in that code example.
// Let me make up another scenario (pseudocodeish):

doA( function() {
  doB();

  doC( function() {
    doD();
  })
  dpE();
});
doF();

*/

// while the experienced among you will correctly identify the trie order of operatios
// here, im betting its more than a little confusing at first glance, and takes concerted mental cycles
// to arrive at. The operations will happen in this order:

// doA()
// doF()
// doB()
// doC()
// doE()
// doD()

/*
// Lets reweire trhe previous nested event/tomeout/ajax example without using nesting
listen( "click", handler);

function handler() {
  setTimeout( request, 500);
}

function request() {
  ajax( "http://some.url.1", response);
}

function response() {
  if (text == "hello") {
    handler();
  }
  else if (text == "world") {
    request();
  }
}


// this formulation of the code is not hardly as recognizable  as having the
// nesting/indentation woes of its previous form, and yet its every bit of
//susceptible callback hell, why?

// As we go to linerly (sequentially) reason about this code, we have to skip
// from one function, to the next, to the next, and bounce all
// around the code base to "see" the sequence flow. And remember this is
// simplified code in sort of best-cast fashion. We all know that
// real async js program code bases are foten fantastically more jumbled, which
// makes such reasoning orders of magnitude more difficult.

// Another thing to notice: to get steps 2,3 and 4 linked together so
// they happen in succession, the only affordance callbacks alone gives us
//  is to hardcode step 2 into step 1 and step 3, into step 2, setp 4 into step 3
// and so on. The hardcoding ist necessarily a bad thing, if it really fixes condition that
// step 2 should always lead to step 3.


// Trust issues
// The missmatch between sequential brain of planning and callbacks driven async js
// code is only part of the problem with callbacks.
// There's something much deeper to beconcerned about.
// Lets once again revisit the notion of a callback function as the continuation
// (aka the second half) of our program:

// ajax( "..", function(...) {
//    C
// });
// B

// A and // B happen now, under the direct control of the main JS program.
// But // C gets deferred to happen later, and under the control of another party
// in this case the ajax(...) function. In a basic sense, that sort of hand off
// of control doesnt regularly cause lots of problems.

// But dont be fooled by its infrequency, and assume that this control switch
// isnt a big deal. In fact its one of the worst problems with callback-driven design.
// It revolves around the idea that sometimes ajax(..) is not a function that you wrote
// or that you directly control. Many times its a utility provided by some third party.
// WE call this "inversion of control" when you take part of your program and
// give over control of its execution to another third party. THeres an unspoken contract
// that  exists between your code and the third-party-utility, a set of  things
// you expect to be maintained.


// Tale of Five Callbacks
// If a users clicks "confirm" to buy a TV you maybe need to call a third-party
// function, so that the sale can be tracked.
// You notice that theyve provided what looks like an async tracking utility,
// probably for the sake of performance best practices, which means you need to pass in a
// callback function, in this continuation that you pass in, you will have the final
// code that charges the customers credit card and displays the thank you page.
// THe code might look like this:

analytics.trackPurchase(purchaseData, function() {
  chargeCreditCard();
  displayThankyouPage();
});



// What if  a customer would get charged 5 times, apparently the developers
// of the third-party utility had been working on some experimental code that
// under certain condidiotns, would retry the provided callback once per second,
// for five seconds, before failing and timing-out.
// Whats next? After some tinkering you implement some simple ad hoc code like
// the following:

var tracked = false;
analytics.trackPurchase( purchaseData, function() {
  if (!tracked) {
    tracked = true;
    chargeCreditCard();
    displayThankyouPage();
  }
});

// Then the QA engineer asks "what happens if they never call the callback?"
// Heres roughÃ¶y the list you come up with of the ways the analytics utility
// could misbehave:

// Call the callback too early (before its tracked)
// Call the callack too late(or never)
// Call the callback too few or too many times (like the problem you encountered)
// Fail to pass along any necessary envioroment/ parameters to your callback
// Swallow any errors/exceptions that may happen

// You are probably starting to realize that yuou are going to have to invent
// an aweful lot of ad hoc logic in each and every single callback thats
// passed to a utility youre not positive you can trust...



// Not just Others Code
// So contemplate this: can you even really trust utilities that you
// theoretically control (in your own code base)?
// Think of it this wayt: most of us agree that atleast to some we
// should build our own internal functions with some defensive checks on the
// input parameters, to reduce / prevent unexpected issues.

// overly trusting input:
function addNumbers(x,y) {
  // + is overloaded with coercion to also be string concatenation,
  // so this operation isnt trictly safe depending on whats passed in
  return x + y;
}

console.log(addNumbers(21, 21)); // 42
console.log(addNumbers( 21, "21")); // 2121


// Defensive against untrusted input:
function addNumbers(x,y) {
  if (typeof x != "number" || typeof y != "number") {
    throw Error("Bad parameters");
  }
  return x + y;
}

console.log(addNumbers( 21, 21)); // 21
console.log(addNumbers(21 , "21")); // Uncaught Error: Bad parameters



// Still ssafe but unfriendlier
function addNumbers(x,y) {
  // ensure numerical input
  x = Number(x);
  y = Number(y);
  // + will safely do numeric addition
  return x + y;
}

console.log(addNumbers(21,21)); // 42
console.log(addNumbers(21, "21")); // 42



// Trying to Save Callbacks
// There are severak variations of callback design that have attempted to address
// some of the trust issues weve just looked at. Its a valiant, but doomed effort
// to save the callback pattern from impoding on iteself.

// For example, regarding more graceful error handling, som API designs provide
// split-callback  (one for the success notification, and one for errror notification)

function success(data) {
  console.log(data);
}
function failure(err) {
  console.log(err);
}
ajax("http://some.url.1", success, failure);

// In APIs of this design, often the failure() error handler is optional, and not
// and if not provided it will be assumed you want the errors swallowed, ugh.
// Another common callback pattern is called "error-first-style"
// (sometimes node-style), where the first argument of a single callback is
// reserved for an error object (if any). If successfull, this arugment will be
// empty/false, but if an error result is being signaled the first argument is set
// truthy.


function response(err, data) {
  // error?
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  // assume success
  else {
    console.log(data);
  }
}
ajax("http://some.url.1.com", response);


// in both cases several things should be observed. FIrst it has not really resolved
// the majority of trust issues like it may appear. HTheres nothing about either callback
// that prevents or filters unwanted repeated invocations. Moreover, things are
// worse now,m because you may get both success and error signals, or neither, and you
// still hhave to code around either of thise conditions.
// What about the trust issue of never being called? If its a concern you likely
// will need to set up a timeout that cancels the event. You could make a utility to
// help you with that:

function timeoutify(fn, delay) {
  var intv = setTimeout( function() {
    intv = nulkl;
    fn( new Error("Timeout!") );
  }, delay);
  return function() {
    // timeout hasnt happened yet
    if(intv) {
      clearTimeout(intv);
      fn.apply(this, arguments)
    }
  };
}

// Here is how you use it:


function foo(err, data) {
  if(err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  else {
    console.log(data);
  }
}
ajax("http://some.url.1.com", timeoutify(foo, 500));



// what if you dont know whether the API in question will always execute async?
// You could invent a utility like this asyncify(..)
// Proof-of-concept:


function asyncify(fn) {
  var orig_fn = fn,
  intv = setTimeout( function() {
    intv = null;
    if (fn) fn();
  }, 0);

  fn = null;

  return function() {
    // firing too quickly, before intv timer has fired to indicate async turn passed
    if (intv) {
      fn = orig_fn.bind.apply(orig_fn,
        [this].concat( [].slice.call(arguments))
      );
         // add the wrappers 'this' to the 'bind(..)' call params, as well as
         // currying any passed in parameters.
    }
    // Already async
    else {
      // invoke original function
      orig_fn.fn.apply(this, arguments);
    }
  };
}


// You suse asyncify() like this:
function result(data) {
console.log(a);
}
var a = 0;
ajax("...pre cached url ...", asyncify(result));
a++;
// This code will always output  1 instead of 0 - result(..) cannot help
// to be invoked asynchronously which means the a++ has a chance to run before
// result(..) does





/*
  PROMISES
*/
/*
// The issue we want to address first is the inversion of control, the
// trust that is so fragilely held and so easily lost.
// we want to say "heres what happens later, after the current step finishes."
// but what if we could uninvert that inversion of control?
// What of instead of handling the continuation of our program to another
// party, we could expect it to return us a capability to know when its task finishes,
// and then our code could decide what to do next?
// This paradigm is called Promises.

// Values now and later
// When you write code to reason about a value as performing math on a number,
// whether you realize it or not youve been assumpting something very fundamental
// about that value, which is that its a concrete now value ready.

var x, y = 2;
console.log( x + y);  //NaN
// The x + y operation assumes both x and y are already set. In terms we'll
// expound on shortly, we assume the x and y values are already resolved.

 // it would be nonesense to expect that the + operator by itself would
 // somehow be magically capable of detecting and waiting around until both x and y
 // are resolved (aka ready) and only then do the operation. That would cause
 // chaos in the program if different statemments finished now and other finished later..

 // How could you possibly reason about the relationships between two statements
 // if either on (or both) of them might not be finished yet?
 // If statement 2 relies on statement 1 being finished, there are just two
 // outcomes: either statement 1 finished right now, and everything proceeds fine,
 // or statement 1 didnt finish yet, and thius statement 2 is goign to fail.

// Lets go back to our x + y operation. Imagine if there was a way to say,
// "add x and y, but if either of them isn't ready yet, just  wait until they are.
// add them  as soon as you can".

// callbacks..

function add(getX, getY, cb){
  var x, y;
  getX( function(xVal){
    x = xVal;
    // both ar ready?
    if (y != undefined) {
      cb(x + y);  // send along sum
    }
  });
  getY( function(yVal) {
    y = yVal;
    // both ready?
    if (x != undefined) {
      cb(x + y);  // send along sum
    }
  });
}
// fetchX() and fetchY() are sync or async functions
add( fetchX, fetchY, function(sum){
  console.log(sum);
})

// In that snippet we treated x an y as future values, and we express an operation
// ad(..) that (from the outside) does not care whether x or y or both are available
// right away. In other words it normalizes the now and latger, such that we can
// rely on a predictable outcome of the add(...) operation.

// By using an add() that is temporally consistent - it behaves the same across
// now and later tiumes- - the async code is much easier to reason about.

// Promise value
//  Lets glimpse at how we can express the x + y example via promises functions:


function add(xPromise, yPromise) {
  // 'Promise.all([..])' takes an array of promises and
  // returns a new promise that waits on them all to finish
  return Promise.all([xPromise, yPromise])

  // when that promise is resolved, lets take the received X and Y
  // values and add them toghether
  .then( function(values) {
    // values is an array of the messages from the previously resolved promises
    return values[0] + values[1]
  });
}
// fetchX() and fetchY() returns promises for their respective values
// which may be ready now or later
add(fetchX(), fetchY())

// we get a promise back for the sum of those two numbers.
// Now we chain-call 'then(..)' to wait for the resolution of that returned promise
.then( function(sum){
  console.log(sum);
});

// There are two layers of promises in this snippet.
// fetchX() and fetchY() are called directly, and the values they return
// (promises) are passed into add(..). The underlying Valuesthose promises represent
// may be ready now or later, but each promise normalizes the behaviour to be the same
// regaredless. We reason about X and Y values in a time-indepentent way.
// They are fututre values.

// The second layer is the promise that add(..) creates (via Promise.all([...]))
// and retunrs, which we wait on by calling then(..) when the add(..) operation
// completes, our sum future value is ready and we can print it out. We hide inside
// of add(..) the logic for waiting on the X and Y future values.


// Inside add(..) the promise.all([ .. ]) call creates a promise which is waiting on
// promiseX and promiseY to resolve. The chained call to .then(..) creates another
// promise, which the return values[0] + values[1] line immediately resolves
// (with the result of the addition)
// Thus , the then(..) call we chain off the end of the add(..) call - at the end
// of the snippet - is actually  operating on that second then promise returned,
// rather than the first one created by promise.all([ .. ]), Also, thought we are not
// chaining off the end of that second then(..) it too has created another promise,
// had we chosen to observe /use it.

// With promises, the then(..) call can actually take two functions, the first
// fulfillment (as showm earlier) and the second for rejection:

add( fetchX(), fetchY() )
.then(// fulfillment handler)
function(sum) {
  console.log(sum);
},
function(err) {
  console.log(err);
});

// If something went wrong getting X or Y , or something somehow failed during
// the addition, the promise that add(..) returns is rejected, and the second
// callback error handler passed to then(..) will receive the rejection value from
// the promise.


// Because promises encapsulate the time dependent state- waiting on the
// fulfillmen t or rejection of the underlying value -- from the outside, the
// promise itself is time-independent, and thus promises can be composed (combined)
// in predictable ways regardless of the timing or outcome underneath.

// Moreover once a promise is resolved, it stays  that way forever it becomes an
// immutable value, at that point - and can then be observed as many times as necassary.


// Completion Event
// As we just saw, an individual Promise behaves as a future value..
// But theres another way to think of resolution of a promise: as a flow-control -
// mechanism - a temporal this-then-that for two or more steps in an a asynchronous task.
// Lets imagine calling a function foo(..) to perform some task. We dont
// know about any of its defails, nor do we care. It may complete the task right away
// or it may take a while. We just simply need to know when foo(..) finishes so that
// we can move on to our next task. In other words wed like a way to be notified of
// foo()'s completion so that we can continue. In typical javascript fashion, if you
// need to listen for a notification you'd likely think of that in terms of events
// So we could reframe out needd for notification as a need to listen for a completion
// event (or continuation event) emitted by foo(..)

// With callbacks the notification would be our callback invoked by the task foo(..)
// but with promises we turn the relationship around, and expect that we can listen for
// an event from foo(..), and when notified, proceed accordingly.
// pseudo code:

foo(x) {

}
foo(42);
on (foo "completion") {

}
on (foo "error") {

}


// We call foo(..) and then we set up two event listeners, one for "Completion"
// and one for "error", the two posible final outcomes of the foo(..) call.
// In essence , foo(..) doesnt even appear to be aware that the calling code has
// subscribed to these events, which makes for a very nice separation of concerns.

// unfortunately, such code would require some magic of the JS enviroment that
// doesnt exist. Heres the more natural way we could expres this in js:

function foo(x) {

// foo() expressly creates an event subscription capability to return back,
// and the calling code receives and registers the two event handlers against it.
// The inversion from normal calback-oriented code should be obvious, and its
// intentional. Insead of passing the callback to foo(..), it returns an event
// capability we call evt, which receives the callbacks.

// Multiple separate parts of the code can be given the event listener capability,
// and they can all independently be notified when foo(..) completes, in order
// to perform subsequent steps:

var evt = 42;
// let  bar(..) listen to foo() completion.
bar(evt);

//
Uninversion of control enables a nicer separation of concerns, where bar()
// don't need to be involved in how foo(..) is called. Similarly foo(..)
// doesnt need to know or care that bar(..) exist or are waiting to be notified
// when foo(..) completes. Essentially this evt object is a netural third-party
// neogation between the separate concerns.

//Promise "Events"
// The evt event listening capability is an aanalogy for a Promise.
// Consider:


function foo(x) {
  // start doind something that could take a while
  // construct and return a promise

  return new Promise( function(resolve, reject){
  // eventually call resolve() or reject()
  // which are the resolution callbacks for the promise
  });
}

var p = foo(42);
bar(p);


// the pattern shown with new Promise(function(){}) is generally called the
// "the revealing constructor pattern". The function passed in is executed
// immediately (not async deferred,, as callback to then(..) are) and its
// provided two parameters, which in this case we've named resolve and reject.
// THese are the resoolution finctions for the promise, resolve(..) generally
// signals fulfillment and reject(..) signals rejection.


function bar(fooPromise) {
  fooPromise.then(
    function() {
      // foo() has now finished so do bar() task
    },
    function() {
      // error
    }
  )
}

// Promise resolution doesntr necessarily need to involve sending along a message,
// as it did when we were examining promises as future values. It can just be a
// flow-control-signal, as used in the previous snipppet.
// Another way to approach this is:

function bar() {
  // foo() has definetely finished so do bar()
}

function errorBar() {
}

var p = foo(42);

p.then(bar, errorBar);

// instead of passing the p promise to bar(..) we use the promise to control when
// bar(..) will get executed, if ever. The primary difference is in the error handlig.

// In the first snippets approach bar() is called regardless of whether fo(..) succeeds
// or fails, and it handles its own fallback logic if its notified that foo(..) failed.
// In the second snippet, bar(..) gets called only if foo(..) succeeeds, and otherwise
// errorBar(..) gets called. Neither approach os correct per se. There will be cases
// where one is preferred over the other. In either case the promise 'p'
// comes back from foo(..) is useed to control what happens next.
// Whenever p is resolved, the next step will always bt the same, both now and later.

//Thenable Duck Typing
// The general term for type checks that make assumptions about a value's type
// based on its shape, (what properties are present) is called duck typing:


if (
  p!= null &&
  (
    typeof p === "object" ||
    typeof p === "function"
  ) &&
  typeof p.then === "function"
) {
  // assume its a thenable!

}
else {
  // not a thenable
}

// If you try to fulfill a promise with any object/function value that happens
// to have a then(..) function on it, but you werent intending it to be treated
// as a promise/thenable, youre out of luck, because it will automatically be
// recognized as thenable and treated with special rules.

// This is even true if you diddnt realize the values has a then(..) on it.
// Example:
var o = {then: function(){}}

// make 'v' be [[Prototype]] - linked to 'o'
var v = Object.create(o);

v.id = 1;
v.role = "admin";

console.log(v.hasOwnProperty("then")); // false

// v doesnt look like a promise or thenable at all. Its just a plain object
// with some properties on it. Youave probably just intending to send
// that value around like any other object.But unknown to you, v is also [[Prototype]]
// - linked to another object o, which happens  to have a then(..) on it. So
// the thenable duck typing checks will think and assume v is a thenable..
// It doersnt even need to be something as directly intentional as that:
Object.prototype.then = function(){};
Array.prototype.then = function(){};
var v1 = { hello: "world" };;
var v2 = [ "hello", "world" ];

// Both v1 and v2 will be assumed to be thenables. You cant control or predict
// if any other code accidentally or maliciously adds then(..) to Object.prototype,
// Array.prototype, or anyu other native prototypes. And if whats specified is a function that
// doesnt call either of its parameters aas callbacks, then  any promise resolved with
// such a value will just silently hang forever.

// But what if a promise itself never gets resolved? Even that is a condition that
// prmoises provide an answer for, using a higher level abstraction called 'race'.


function foo() {
  console.log("foo");
}

// a utility for timing out a Promise:
function timeoutPromise(delay) {
  return new Promise( function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout( function() {
      reject("Timeout");
    }, delay);
  });
}

// setup timeout for foo()
Promise.race([
  foo(),
  timeoutPromise(3000)
]).then(
  function() {
    // foo() is fulfilled in time
    console.log("foo done");
  },
  function(err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
)
// foo
// foo done


// Swallowing any Errors/Exceptions
// If at any point in the creation of a promise, or in the observation of its
// resolution, a JS exception occurs, such as a TypeError or ReferenceError, that
// exception will be caught, and it will firce the promise in question to becode
// rejected . For example:

var p = new Promise( function(resolve, reject) {
  foo.bar();
  resolve(42);
})

p.then(
  function fulfilled() {
    console.log("done");
  },
  function rejected(err) {
    console.log(err); //ReferenceError: foo is not defined
  }
);


// The js exception that occurs from foo.bar() becomes a promise rejection that you
// can catch and respond to. But what happens if a Promise is fulfilled but
// there s a JS exception error during the observation in a then(..) registered callback?
// Even those arent lost, but you may find how they are handled a bit surprising
// until you dig deeper:

var p = new Promise( function(resolve, reject) {
  resolve(42);
});


p.then(
  function fulfilled(msg) {
    foo.bar();
    console.log(msg); // never gets here..
  },
  function rejected(err) {
    console.log(err); // never gets here ..
  }
);


// If you pass an immediate, non-promise non-thenable value to promise.resolve()
// you get a promise thats fulfilled with that value. In this case promises p1 and p2
// will behave identically:

var p1 = new Promise( function(resolve, reject) {
  resolve(42);
});

var p2 = Promise.resolve(42)

// BHut if you pass a genuine promise to promise.resolve(..) you just get
// the same promise back:

var p1 = Promise.resolve(42);
var p2 = Promise.resolve(p1);
console.log(p1 === p2); // true

// Even more importantly, if you pass a non-promise thenable value to Promise.resolve(..)
// it will attempt to unwrap that value, and the unwrapping will keep going until
// a concrete final non-promise-like value is extracted:

var p = {
  then: function(callback) {
    callback(42);
  }
};

p.then(
  function fulfilled(val) {
    console.log(val); // 42
  },
  function rejected(err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
)

// The p is thenable, but its not a genuine Promise. Luckily its reasonable,
// as most will be. But what if you got back instead something that looked like:

var p = {
  then: function(cb, errcb) {
    cb(42);
    errcb("error")
  }
};

p.then(
  function fulfilled(val) {
    console.log(val);
  },
  function rejected(err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
)


// the p is thenable but its not so well behaved of a promise. Is it
// malicious? Or is it just ignorant how Promises should work?
// it doesnt matter, in either case its not trustable as is.
// Nonetheless, we can pass either of these versions of p to Pormise.resolve(...)
// and well get the normalized,  safe result wed expect:

Promise.resolve(p)
.then(
  function fulfilled(val) {
    console.log(val);
  },
  function rejected(err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
)

// promise.resolve() will accept any thenable, and unwrap it to its nonthenable value.
// But you get back  from promise.resolve(..) a real, genuine Promise in its place,
// one that you can trust. If what you passed in is already a genuine promise, you
// just get it right back, so theres no downside at all to filtering through
// Promise.resolve(..) to gain trust.

// So lets say we are calling a foo(..) utility and we are not sure we can trust its return
// value to be a well-behaving promise, but we know ots at least a thenable Promise.resolve()
// will give is a trustable promise wrapper to chain off of:

// don't just do this:
foo(42)
.then( function(v){
  console.log(v);
});

// instead do this:

Promise.resolve(foo(42))
.then( function(v) {
  console.log(v);
})



// Chain FLow
// We can string multiple promises tighether to represent a sequence of async steps.
// The key to making this work is built on two behaviours intrinsic to promises.

// Every time you call then(..) on a promise, it creates and returns new Promise,
// which we can chain with.
// Whatever value you return from the then(..) calls fulfilllment callback
// (the first parameter) is automatically set as the fulfillment of the chained
// promise (from the first point)
// Lets illustrate what that means, and then well derive how that helps us create
// async sequences of flow control. COnsider the following:

var p = Promise.resolve(21);

var p2 = p.then( function(v){
  console.log(v); // 21

  return v * 2;
});

// chain off p2
p2.then(function(v){
  console.log(v); // 42
});

// By returning v * 2 we fulfill the p2 promise that the first then(..) call
// created and returned. When p2's then(..) call runs, its receiveing the fulfillment
// from the return v * 2 statement. Of course p2.then(..) creates yet another promise
// which we could have stored in a p3 variable.
// But its a little annoyying to have to create an intermediate variable
// p2 (or p3 etc). Thankfully we can easily just chain these toghether

var p = Promise.resolve(21);

p.then( function(v) {
  return v * 2;
}).then( function(v) {
  console.log(v);
})

// So now the first then(..) is the first step in an async sequence, and the second
// then(..) is the second step. This could keep going for as long as you need it
// to extend. Just keep chaining off a previous then(..) with each automatically created Promise.

// What if we wwant step 2 to wait for step 1 to do something asynchronous?
// We're using an immediate return statement, which immediately fulfills the
// chained promise. The key to making a promise sequence tryly async capable
// at every step is to recall how Promise.resolve(...) operates when what you
// pass to it is a Promise or thenable instead of a final value, Promise.resolve(..)
// directly returns a received genuine Proomise, or it unwraps the value of received
// thenable, - and keeps going recursively while it keeps unwrapping thenables.

// The same sort of unwrapping happens if you return a thenable or promise
// from the fulfillment (or rejection) handler, consider:


var p = Promise.resolve(21);

p.then( function(v) {
  console.log(v);  // 21
  // create a promise and return it
  return new Promise( function(resolve, reject) {
    resolve( v * 2);
  });
})
.then( function(v) {
  console.log(v); // 42
});

// even though we wrapped 42 up in a promise that we returned, it still got
// unwrapped and ended up as the resolution of the chained promise, such that the
// second then(..) still receuved 42. If we intoduce asynchrony to that wrapping
// promise, everything still nicely works the same:

var p = Promise.resolve(21);

p.then( function(v) {
  console.log(v); // 21

  return new Promise( function(resolve, reject) {
    // introduce asynchrony
    setTimeout( function() {
      // fulfill with value '42'
      resolve( v * 2);
    }, 100);
  });
})

.then( function(v){
  console.log(v); // 42
});

// Lets generalize a delay-promise creation into a utility we can reuse for
// multiple steps:

function delay(time) {
  return new Promise( function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(resolve, time);
  });
}

delay(100)
.then( function STEP2() {
  console.log("step 2 (after 100ms)");
  return delay(200);
})
.then( function STEP3() {
  console.log("step 3 (after 200ms)");
})
.then( function STEP4() {
  console.log("step 4 (next job)");
})
.then( function STEP5(){
  console.log("step 5 (after another 50ms)");
});

// Calling delay (200) creates a promise that will fulfill in 20ms, and then we
// return that from the first then(..) fulfillment callback, which causes the
// second then(..)'s promise to wait on that 200ms promise.


// Instead of timers, lets consider makking ajax requests.

// Promise-aware ajax
function request(url) {
  return new Promise( function(resolve, reject) {
    ajax(url, resolve)
  });
}

// first we define request() utility constructs a promise to represebt the
// completion of the axjax() call.

request("http://some.url.1/")
.then ( function(response1) {
  return request("http://some.url.1/" + response1)
})
.then( function(response2) {
  console.log(response2);
});

// once response1 comes back we use the  value to construct a second URL, and
// make a second request(..) call. That second request(...) primise is returned
// so tthat the third step in our async flow control waits for that ajax to complete.
// Finally, we print respose2 once it returns.

// The promise chain we construct is not only a flow control that expresses a
// multistep async sequence, but it also acts as a message channel to propagate
// messsages from step to step.

// What if somethiung went wrong in one of the steps of the Promise chain?
// An error/exception is on per-promise basis, which means its possible to
// catch such an error at any point in the chain, and that catching acts to sort
// of "reset" the chain back to normal operation at that point:
// step 1
request("http://some.url.1")
// step 2
.then( function(response1) {
  foo.bar(); // undefined error
  // never gets here
  return request ("http://some.url.2/?v=" + response1)
})
.then( function fulfilled(reponse2) {
  // never gets here
}, // rejection handler to catch error
function rejected(err) {
  console.log(err);
  return 42;
}) // step 4
.then( function(msg){
  console.log(msg);
});

/*
// If you call then(..)  on a promise, and you only pass a fulfillment handler to it,
// an assumed rejection handler is substituted

var p = new Promise( function(resolve, reject){

});

var p2 = p.then( function fulfilled(){
  // never gets here
}
/*
 // assumed rejection handler, if omitted
 // any other non-function value passed
// function(err) {
// throw err;
});




// Error Handling
// The most natural form of error handling for most developers is
// the synchronous try..catch construct. unfortunately its synchronous-only, so
// it fails to help in async code patterns.

// In callbacks, some standards have emerged for patterned error handling, most
// notably error-first callback-style.

function foo(callback) {
  setTimeout( function() {
    try {
      var x = baz.bar();
      callback(null, x);
    }
    catch (err) {
      console.log(err); //  baz is not defined
    }
  }, 100);
}

foo(function(err, val){
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  } else {
    console.log(val);
  }
})

// the callback we pass to foo() expects to receive a signal of an error by the
// reserved first parameter, err, if present, error is assumed, if not success
// is assumed. This sort of error handlig is technically async capable, but it
// does not composee well at all. Multiple levels of  error-first callbacks doesnt
// woven together with these ubiquitos if statement checks will inevitably lead
// you to the perils of callback hell.

// So we come back to error handling in promises, with the rejection handler passed
// to then(..) Promises with the rejection handler passed to then(..)
// Promises dont use the popular error-first callback design style, but instead
// use split-callback style, theres one callback for fulfillment and one for rejection:


var p = Promise.reject("error");

p.then( function fulfilled(){
  // never gets here
},
function rejected(err) {
    console.log(err); // error
});
// while this pattern of error handling makes fine sense on the surface,
// the nuances of promise error handlig are often fair bit more difficult to
// fully graps, consider:


var p = Promise.resolve(42);

p.then( function fulfilled(msg){
  console.log(msg.toLowerCase()); // msg.toLowerCase is not a function
},
function rejected(err) {
  console.log(err);
});

// if the msg.toLowerCase() legitimately throws an error (it does) why doesnt
// our error handler get notified? as we exaplained earlier, its because
// that error handler is for the p promise, which has already been fulfilled with value 42
// The p promise is immutable,, so the only promise that can be notified of the error
// is the one returned from p.then() which in this case we don't capture.

// To avoind loosing an error to the silence of a forgotten / discarded promise,
// some developers have claimed that the best proctice for promise chains is to
// always end your chain with a final catch() like:


var p = Promise.resolve(42);

p.then( function fulfilled(msg){
  console.log(msg.toLowerCase());
})
.catch(handleErrors);



// Promise.all([..])
// in async sequence (promise chain) only one task is being coordinated at any
// given moment, step 2 strictly follows step 1, and step 3 follows step 2.
// But what about doing two or mor esteps concurrently (aka "in paralell")?
// In the promise API we call this pattern "all([..])"
// Say you wanted to make two ajax requests at the same time, and wait for
// both to finishm, regardless of their order, before making a third request:

var p1 = $.ajax("data.txt");
var p2 = $.ajax("data.txt");

function request(url) {
  $.ajax({url: url})
}
Promise.all( [p1, p2] )
.then( function(msgs) {
  //both p1 and p2 fulfill and pass in their messages here
console.log(msgs);
  //return request(
  //  "http://some.url.3/?v=" + msgs.join(",")
  //);
})
.then( function(msg){
  console.log(msg);
});


// Promise.all([..]) expects a single argument, an array consisting generally of
// promise instances. The promise returned from the promise.all([..]) call will receive
// a fulfillment message (msgs in this snippet) that is an array of all the fulfullment
// messages from the passed in promises, in the same order specified (regardless of
// fulfillment order)

// Promise Race([..])
// While promise.all coordinates multiple promises concurrently and assumes all
// are needed for fullfillment, sometimes you want to respond only to the first promise.
// This pattern is clasically called a "latch", but in promises its called a race.

// Promice.race([..]) also expects a single array argument, conctaining one or more
// promises, thenables, or immediate values. IT doesnt take much more practical
// sense to have a race with immediate values, because the first one listed will
// obviously win. Similiar to promise.all([..]) promise.race([..]) will
// fulfill if and when any promise resolution is a fulfillment, and it will
// reject if and when any promise resolution is rejection.

// lets revisit our previous concuirrent ajax example, but in the context of
// a race between p1 and p2

function request(url){
  return $.ajax({url:url});
}

var p1 = request("data1.txt");
var p2 = request("data0.txt");

Promise.race( [p1, p2] )
.then( function(msg){
  console.log(msg);
})
.then( function(msg){
  console.log(msg);
})


// Timeout race
// We saw this example earlier, illustrating how Promise.race([..]) can be
// used to express the Promise timeout pattern
// foo() is a promise-aware function
// timeoutPromise(..) define earlier returns a promise that rejects a specified
// delay


function foo() {
  console.log("foo");
}

// a utility for timing out a Promise:
function timeoutPromise(delay) {
  return new Promise( function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout( function() {
      reject("Timeout");
    }, delay);
  });
}

// setup a timeout for foo()
Promise.race([
  foo(),
  timeoutPromise(100)
])
.then(
  function(){
    // foo(..) fulfilled in time
    console.log("promise done");
  },
  function(err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
);

// Finally
// the key question to ask is, "what happens to the promise that get discarded?"
// It would typically end up garbage collection eligible, but from behavioral
// perspective promises cannot be canceled. Some developers have proposed that
// Promises need a "finally(..)" callback registration, which is always called
// when a promise resolves and allows you to specify any cleanup the may be
// necessary. This doesnt exist in the specification at the moment, but it may
// come in ES7. It might look like this:

var p = Promise.resolve(42);

p.then(foo)
.finally(cleanup)
.then(bar)
.finally(cleanup);


// In the meantime we could make a static helper utility that lets us observe
// without interfering  with.. the resolution of a Promise:


// a utility for timing out a Promise:
function timeoutPromise(delay) {
  return new Promise( function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout( function() {
      reject("Timeout");
    }, delay);
  });
}


function foo() {
  console.log("foo");
}


// polyfill-safe guard check
if (!Promise.observe) {
  Promise.observe = function(pr,cb) {
    pr.then(
      function rejected(err) {
        Promise.resolve(err).then(cb);
      }
    );
    return pr;
  };
}

// Here's how we'd use it in the timout example from before:
Promise.race([
  Promise.observe(
    foo(),
    function cleanup(msg) {
      console.log("cleanup");
    }
  ),
  timeoutPromise(3000)
])


// Variations on all([..]) and race([..])
// While native ES6 promises come with built-in Promise.all([..]) and Promise.race([...])
// there are several other commonly used patterns with variations on those semantics:

// none([..])
// this pattern is like all([..]) but fulfillments and rejections are transposed.
// All promises need to be rejected - rejections become the fulfillment values
// and vice versa.

// any([..])
// This pattern is like all([..]) but ignores any rejectuibs so only one
// needs to fulfill instead of all of them

// first([..])
// This pattern is like a race with any([..]), which means that it ignores any
// rejections and fulfills as soon as the promise fulfills.

// last([..])
// This pattern is like first([..]) but only the latest fulfillment wins.

// Some Promise abstraction libraries provide these, but you could also define
// them yourself using the mechanics of promises race([..]) and all([..])

// For example, heres how we could define first([..])

//polyfill-safe guard check
if (!Promise.first) {
  Promise.first = function(prs) {
    return new Promise( function(resolve, reject){
      prs.forEach( function(pr){
        Promise.resolve(pr)
        .then(resolve);
      });
    });
  };
}


// Concurrent Iterations
// Sometimes you want to iterate over a list of promises and perform some tasks
// against all of them, much like you can do with synchronous arrays, map() some()
// every() etc. If the task to perform against each promise is fundamentally
// synchronous, these work fine, just as we used forEach() in the previous snippet

// lets consider an asynchronous map(..) utility that takes an array of values plus
// a function (Task) to perform against each. map(..) itself returns a promise
// whose fulfillment value is an array that holds (in the same mapping order)
// the async fulfillment value from each task:

if (!Promise.map) {
  Promise.map = function(vals, cb) {
    return Promise.all(
      vals.map( function(val) {
        return new Promise( function(resolve){
          cb(val, resolve);
        });
      })
    );
  };
}


// lets illustrate using map(..) with a list of promises (instead of values)

var p1 = Promise.resolve(21);
var p2 = Promise.resolve(42);
var p3 = Promise.resolve("error");

// double values in list even if theyre in Promises
Promise.map( [p1, p2, p3], function(pr, done) {
  Promise.resolve(pr)
  .then(
    // extract value as 'v'
    function(v) {
      done(v*2);
      console.log("done");
    },
  );
})
.then( function(vals){
  console.log(vals);
});


// Promise API recap
//the revealing constructor Promise(..) must be used with "new", and must be
// provided a function callback, which is synchronously/immediately called.
//This function is passed two function callbacks that act as resolution
// capabilities for the promse. We commonly label these resolve(..) and reject(..)

var p = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
  // resolve(..)
  // reject(..)
});


// Promise.resolve(..) and Promise.reject(..)
// A shortcut for creating an already-rejected Promise is Promise.reject(..),
// so these two promises are equivalent:

var p1 = new Promise( function(resolve,reject){
  reject("error")
});

var p2 = Promise.reject("error")


var fulfilledTh = {
  then: function(cb) {
     cb(42);
   }
};

var rejectedTh = {
  then: function(cb,errCb) {
    errCb("error");
  }
};


var p1 = Promise.resolve(fulfilledTh);
var p2 = Promise.resolve(rejectedTh);

// Promise.resolve doesnt do anyuthing if what you pass in is already a genuine
// prommise. It just returns the value directly.


// Then.(..) & Catch(..)
// Each promise.resolve(..) has then(..)  and catch(..) methods, which allows
// registering of fulfillment and rejection handlers for the promise.
// Once the Promise is resolved, one or the other of these handlers will be called
// but not both,  and it will always be called asynchronously.

// then(..) takes one or two parameters, the first for the fulfillment callback
// and the second for the rejection callback. If either is omitted or is is
// Otherwise passed as a non-function value, a default callback is substituded
// respectively. The default fulfillment callback simply passes the message along,
// while  the default rejection callbackj simply rethrows (propagates) the error
// reason it receives.

// catch(..) takes only one rejection callback as a parameter, and automatically
// substitutes the default fulfillment callback, as just discussed.
// On othjer words it's equivalennt to then(null,..)

p.then(fulfilled);
p.then(fulfilled, rejected);
p.catch(rejected); // or p.then(null, rejected)

// then(..) and catch(..) also create and return a new promise which can be used to
// epxress promise chain flow control. If the fultillment or rejection callbacks have
// an exception thrown, the returned promise is rejected. If either
// callback returns an immediate, non promise, nnon-thenable value, that value is
// set as the fulfillment for the returned promise. If the fulfillment handler
// specifically returns a promise or thenable value, that value is unwrapped
// and becomes the resolution of the returned promise.


// Promise.all([..]) & Promise.race([..])
// The static helpers Promise.all([...]) and Promise.race([...]), on the ES6
// Promise API both create a promise as their return value. The resolution of
// that promise is controlled entirely by the array of promises that you
// pass in.

// For Promise.all([..]) , all the promoises you pass in must fulfill for the
// returned promise to fulfill. If any promise is rejected, the main returned
// promise is immediately rejected too. For fulfillment, you receive an array
// of all the passed in promises fulfillment values. For rejection, you
// receive just the first promise rejection reason value. This pattern is
// clasically called a gate: all must arrive before the gate opens.

// For promise.race([..]) only the first promise to resolve wins, and whatever the
// resolution is becomesk the resolution of the returned promise. This pattern
// is clasically called a "latch": the first one to open the latch gets through.
// Consider:




var p1 = Promise.resolve(42);
var p2 = Promise.resolve("hello world");
var p3 = Promise.reject("error");

Promise.race([p1, p2, p3])
.then( function(msg) {
  console.log(msg); // 42
});

Promise.all([p1, p2, p3])
.catch( function(err){
  console.log(err); // error
});

Promise.all([p1,p2])
.then( function(msgs) {
  console.log(msgs); // [42, "hello world"]
});


// If you construct a promise chain with that has no error handling in it,
// any error anywhere in the chain will propagate indefinetely down the chain,
// until observed (by registering a rejection handler at somes step)
// So in that specific case, having a reference to the last promise in the
// chain is enough, (p in the following snirppet) because you can register a
// rejection handler there, and it will be notified of any progagated errors.

// foo(...) STEP2(...) STEP3(...) are all promise-aware utilities.
// Although it may seem sneakily confusing, p here doesnt point to the first
// promise in the chain(the one from the foo(42) call), but instead from the
// last promise, the one that comes from the then(STEP3) call.

// Also, no step in the promise chain is observably doing its own error handling.
// That means that you could register a rejection error handler on p, and it would
// be notidied if any errors occur anyuwhere in the chain:

p.catch(handleErrors);


// But if any step of the chain in fact does its own error handling
// (perhaps hidden/abstracted away from what you can see), your handleErrors(..)
// won't be notified. This may be what you want , it was after all, a
// "handled rejection" -- but it also may not be what you want. The complete
// lack of ability to be notified is a limitation that restricts capabilities
// in some use cases.

// Its basically the same limitation that exists with a try..catch that can catch
// an expcetion and simply swallow it. So this isnt a limitation unique to promises,
// but is something we might wish to have a workaround for.

// unfortunately many times there is no reference kept for the intermeduate steps
// in a promise-chain sequence, so without such references you cannot attach error
// handlers to reliably observe the errors.

// Single Value
// Promises by defentition only have a single fulfillment valye or a single rejection
// reason. In simple examples, this isnt that big of a deal, but in more
// sophisticated scenarios you may find this limiting.

// The typical advice is to construct a values wrapper (such as an object or array)
// to contain these multiple messages. This solution works, but it cant be quite
// awkward and tedious to wrap and unwrap your messages with every single step of your
// promise chain.

// Splittig Values
// sometimes you can take this as a signal that you could/should decompose the
// problem into two or more promises.
// Imagine you have a utility foo(..) that produces two values (x and y)
// synchronously:

function getY(x) {
  return new Promise( function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout( function(){
      resolve( (3 * x) - 1);
    }, 100);
  });
}

function foo(bar, baz) {
  var x = bar * baz;

  return getY(x)
  .then( function(y){
    return [x,y]
  });
}

foo(10, 20)
.then( function(msgs){
  var x = msgs[0];
  var y = msgs[1];
  console.log(x, y);
});

// First lets rearrange what foo(..) returns so that we dont have to wrap x and y
// into a single array value transport through one promise, we can wrap each value
// into its own promise:

function getY(x) {
  return new Promise( function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout( function(){
      resolve( (3 * x) - 1);
    }, 100);
  });
}

function foo(bar,baz) {
  var x = bar * baz;
  // return both promises
  return [
    Promise.resolve(x), getY(x)
  ];
}

Promise.all([
  foo(10, 20)
])
.then( function(msgs) {
  var x = msgs[0];
  var y = msgs[1];

  console.log(x, y);
});

// Is an array of promises really better than an array of values passed
// through a single promise? Syntactically its not much of an improvement.

// But this approach clesely embraces the promise design theory.
// It's now easier inthe future to refactor to split the calculation of x and y
// into separate functions. Its cleaner and more flexible to let the calling code
// decide how to orchestrate the two promises - using Promise.all([..]) here,
// but certainly not the only option - rather than to abstract such details away inside foo(..)

// Unwrap / Spread Arguments
// The x = .. and var y= .. assignments are still awkward overhead.
function spread(fn) {
  return Function.apply.bind(fn, null);
}

function foo(bar, baz) {
  var x = bar * baz;

  return getY(x)
  .then( function(y){
    return [x,y]
  });
}

function getY(x) {
  return new Promise( function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout( function(){
      resolve( (3 * x) - 1);
    }, 100);
  });
}

Promise.all([
  foo(10, 20)
])
.then(
  spread( function(x,y) {
    console.log(x,y); // 200 599
  })
)

// thatsa bit nicer. Of course you could inline some ..

Promise.all(
  foo(10,20)
)
.then( Function.apply.bind(
  function(x,y) {
    console.log(x, y); // 200 599
  },
  null
));

// But best of  all, ES6 offers the array parameter destructuring form:
Promise.all(
  foo(10, 20)
)
.then( function([x,y]) {
  console.log(x, y);
})



// But there's also a lot of async that fit into a different model - one that's
// more akin to events and/or streams of data. Its not clear on the surface how
// well promises can fit into such use cases, if at all.
// Without a significant abstraction on the top of promises, they will completely
// fall short for handlig multiple value resolution.


// Imagine a scenario where you might want to fire off a sequence of async steps
// in reoinse to a stimulus (like an event) that can in fact happen multiple tiumes,
// like a button click.

// This probably wont work the way you want:

// click(..) binds the '"click"' event to a DOM element
// requests(..)  is the previouslyy defined promise-aware ajax

function request(url) {
  $.ajax(url);
  console.log(url);
}

var p = new Promise( function(resolve, reject){
  ("#btn_login", resolve)
});

p.then( function(evt){
  var btnID = evt.currentTarget;
  return request("data1.txt");
})
.then( function(text){
  console.log(text);
})


// the behaviour here works only if your application calls for the button to be
// clicked just once. If the button is clicked a second time, the p promise has
// already been resolved, so the second resolve(..) call would be ignored.

// Instead, youd probably need to invert the paradigm, creating a whole new promise
// chain for each event firing.

function request(url) {
  $.ajax(url);
  console.log(url);
}

click("#btn_login", function(evt){
  var btnID = evt.currentTarget.id;

  request("data1.txt" + btnID)
  .then( function(text) {
    console.log(text);
  });
});


// This approach will work in that a whole new promise sequence will be fired
// off for each "click" event on the button.
// But beyond just the ugliness of having to define the entire promise chain
// inside the event handler, this design in some respects violates the idea of
// separation of concerns/capabilioties (SoC). You might very well want to define
// your event handler in a different place in your code from where you define
// the response to the event (the promise chain). Thats pretty awkward to do in
// this pattern, without helper mechanisms.

// "a code base in motion (with callbacks) will remain in motion unless acted upon
// by a smart, Promises-aware developer".
// Consider a callback-based scnenario like the following:

function foo(x,y,cb) {
  $.ajax("data0.txt", + x + "&y" + y + cb);
}

foo(11, 31, function(err,text){
  if(err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  else {
    console.log(text);
  }
});

// We need an Ajax utility that is Promise aware instead of callback-based,
// which we coiuld call request(..). You can make your own, as we have already.
// But the overhead of having to manually define promise-aware wrappers for every
// callback-based utility makes it less likely youll choose to refactor to promise
// -aware coding at all.

// Promises offer no direct answer to that limitation. Most promise libraries
// do offer a helper, however. But even wothout a library, image a helper like
// this:

// polyfill-safeguard check
if (!Promise.wrap) {
  Promise.wrap = function(fn) {
    return function() {
      var args = [].slize.call(arguments);

      return new Promise( function(resolve, reject) {
        fn.apply(
          null,
          args.concat( function(err,v) {
            if (err) {
              reject(err);
            } else {
                resolve(v);
            }
          })
        );
      });
    };
  };
}

// Promise.wrap(..) does not produce a promise. It  prodduces a function that will
// produce Promises. In a sense, a Promise-prducing function could be seen as a Promise
// factory. I propose "promisory" as the name for such a thing

// The act of wrapping a callback-expecting function to bbe a Promise-aware
// function is sometimes  referred to as "lifting", or "promisifying"
// But there doesnt seem to be a standard term for what to call the
// resultant function other than a "lifted function".

// So Promise.wrap(ajax) produces an ajax)..  promisory we call request(..)
// and that promisory pÃ¥roduces Promises for ajax responses.

// Of all functions were already promisories, we weouldnt need to make them ourselves,
// so the extra step is a tad bit of a shame. But at least the wrapping pattern
// is usually repeatable so we can put it into a Promise.wrap(..) helper as shown
// to aid our promise coding.

// So back to our previous example, we need a promisory for both ajax(..) and foo(..)


function request(url) {
  return new Promise( function(resolve, reject) {
    $.ajax(url, resolve);
  });
}

var request = Promise.wrap(ajax);

function foo(x,y,cb){
  request(
    "data0.txt" + x + y
  )
  .then(
    function fulfilled(text) {
      cb(null, text);
    },
    cb
  );
}

// nowmm for this codes purposes make a promisory for "foo()"

var betterFoo = Promise.wrap(foo);

betterFoo(11,31)
.then(
  function fulfilled(text) {
    console.log(text);
  },
  function rejected(err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
);


//O fcourse while were refactioring foo(..) to use our new request(..) promisory,
// we could just make foo(..) a promisory itself, instead or remaining callback-based
// and needing to make and use the subsequent betterFoo(..)
// This decision just depends on whether foo(..) needs to stay callback-based
// compatible with other parts of the code base. Consider:

// foo(..) //  is now also a promisory because it delegates to the request(..) promisory
function foo(x,y) {
  return request(
    "data0.txt"
  );
}

function request(url) {
  return new Promise( function(resolve, reject) {
    $.ajax(url, resolve);
  });
}

foo(11,11);



// Promise Uncancelable
// Once you create a promise and register a fulfillment and or rejection handler
// for ot, theres nothing external you can do to stop that progression if something
//else happens to make that task moot.

//Consider our promise timeout scenario from ealier:


function foo(x) {
  console.log(x);
}

function doSomething() {
  console.log("something");
}

function handleError(err) {
  console.log(err);
}

// a utility for timing out a Promise:
function timeoutPromise(delay) {
  return new Promise( function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout( function() {
      reject("Timeout");
    }, delay);
  });
}

var p = foo(42);

Promise.race([
  p,
  timeoutPromise(300)
])
.then(
  doSomething,
  handleError
);
p.then( function() {
  console.log("");
});

// The"timeout" was external to the promise p, so p itself keeps going which we
// probably dont want. One option is to invasively define your callbacks:


var OK = true;
var p = foo(42);

Promise.race([
  p,
  timeoutPromise(3000)
  .catch( function(err) {
    OK = false;
    throw err;
  })
])
.then(
  doSomething,
  handleError
);
p.then( function() {
  if(OK) {
    console.log("only happens if we have no timeout");
  }
});


// This is ugly but it works.



/*
  GENERATORS
*/
/*
var x = 1;

function foo() {
  x++;
  bar();
  console.log("x", x);
}

function bar() {
  x++;
}

foo(); // x 3


// in this example, we know for sure that bar() runs in between x++ and console.log(x)
// But what if var() wasnt there? obviously the result would be 2 instead of 3
//Now lets twist your brain. What if bar() wasnt present, but it could still somehow
// run between the x++ and console.log(x) statements, how would that be possible?

// Inpreemptive multithreaded languages, it would essentially be possible for bar()
// to interrupt and run at exactly the right moment between those statemens. And yet,
// a cooperative form of this interruption (concurrency) is possible, if foo()
// itself could somehow indicate a pause at that part in the code.

// Here's the ES6 code to accomposh such a cooperative concurrency:

var x = 1;

function *foo() {
  x++
  yield; // pause!
  console.log("x:", x);
}

function bar() {
  x++;
}

// Now, how can we run the code in that previous snippet such as that bar()
// executes at the point of the yield inside of *foo()?

// Construct an iterator 'it' to control the generator

var it = foo();

// start foo() here
console.log(x);
it.next();
console.log(x);
bar();
console.log(x);
it.next();

// The it = foo() operation does not execute the *foo() generator yet, but it
// constructs an iterator that will control its execution.
// The first it.next() starts the *foo() generator, x++ on the first line of *foo().
// *foo() pauses at the yield statement at wich point that first it.next() call finishes.
// At the moment *foo() is still running and active, but its in a paused state.
// We inspect the value of x, and its now 2.
// We call bar(), which increments x again with x++
// We inspect the value of x again, and its now 3
// The final it.next() call resumes the *foo() generator from where it was paused,
// and runs the console.log(..) statement, which uses the current value of x of 3.


// Clearly, foo() started, but did not run-to-completion - it paused at the yield
// We resumed foo() later, and let it finish, but that wasnt even required.

// So a generator is a special kind of function that can start and stop one
// or more trimes, and doesnt necessarily ever have to finish.
// Whilei it wont be terribly obvious yet why thats so powerful, as we go
// througout the rest of this chapter, that will be one of the fundamental
// building blocks we use to construct generators-as-async-flow-contol as a pattern
// of our code.

// Input and Output
// A generator is a special function with the new processing model we just alluded to.
// But its still a function, which means it still has some basic tenets that
// havent changed -- namely, that it still accept arguments (aka input) and
// that it can still return a value (aka output):


function *foo(x, y) {
  return x * y;
}

var it = foo(6, 7);
res = it.next();

console.log(res.value); // 42

// We pass in  the argument 6 and 7 to *foo(..) as the parameters x and y, respectively
// And *foo(..) returns the value 42 back to the calling code.

// We now see a difference with how the generator is invoked compared to a
// normal function, foo(6,7) obviously looks familiar. But subtly, the  *foo(..)
// generator hasnt actually run yet as it would have with a function.

// Instead we're just creating an iterator object, which we assign to the
// variable it, to control the *foo(..) generator. Then we call it.next(), which
// instructs the *foo(..)  generator to advance from its current location,
// stopping either at the next yield or ned of the generator.

// The result of that next(..) call is an object with a value property on it holding
// whatever value (if any) was returned from *foo(..) In other words, yield caused
// a value to be sent out fromt the generator during the middle of its execution
// kind of like an intermediate return.

// Aghain, it won't be obvious yet why we need this whole inderect iterator object to
// control the generator..

// Iteration Messaging
// In addition to generators accepting arguments and having return values, theres
// even more powerful compelling input/output messaging capability built into them
// via yield, and next(..) Consider:


function *foo(x) {
  var y = x * (yield);
  return y;
}
var it = foo(6);

// start 'foo(..)'
it.next();

var res = it.next(7);
console.log(res.value); // 42

// First we pass in 6 as the parameter x, then we call it.next() and it
// starts uo *foo(..) Inside *foo(..) the var y = x.. statement starts to be
// processed, but it runs across a yield expression. At that point it pauses
// *foo(..) (in the middle of the assignment statement) and essentially
// requests the calling code to provide a result value for the yield expresion.
// Next, we call it.next(7) which is passing the value back in to be that result
// of the paused yield expression.

// So at this point the assingment statements is essentially var y = 6 * 7.
// Now, return y returns that 42 value back as the result of the it.next(7) call.

// Notice something very important but also easily confusing, even to seasoned js
// developers: depeinding on your perspective, there's a mismatch between the
// yield and the next(..) call. In general, you're going to have one more next(..)
// call than you have yield statements - the preceeding snippet has one yield
// and two next(..) calls.. Why the mismatch?

// Because the first next(..) always starts a generator, and runs to the first yield
// But it's the second next(..) call that fulfills the first paused yield expression,
// and the third next(..) would fulfill the second yield, and so on..

// Tale of Two Questions
// Actually, which code you're thinking about primarily will affect whether there's
// perceived mismatch or not. Consider only generator code:

var y = x * (yield);
return y;

// The first yield basically asking a question: "what value should i insert here?"
// Who's going to answer that question? Well, the first next() has already run to
// get the generator up to this point, so obviously it can't answer the question.
// So the second next(..) call must answer the question posed by the first yield.
// See the mismatch - second-to-first?

// But let's flip our perspective. Let's look at it not from the generator's point
// of view, but from the iterator's point of view.

// To properly illustrate this perspecitve, we also need to explain that messages
// can go in both directions -- yield .. as an expression can send out messages in
// reponse to next(..) calls, and next(..) can send values to a paused yield expresion.
// COnsider this slightly adjusted code:


function *foo(x) {
  var y = x * (yield "Hello");
  return y;
}

var it = foo(6);
var res = it.next(); // first 'next()', dont pass anything

console.log(res.value); // Hello

res = it.next(7); // pass '7' to waiting 'yield'
console.log(res.value); // 42

// yield.. and next(..) pair together as two-way-message passing system during the
// execution of the generator.

// We don't pass a value to the first next() call, and that's on purpose.
// ONly a paused yield could accept such a value passed by next(..),
// and at the beginning of the generator when we call the first next(), there
// is no paused yield to accept such a value. The specification and all
// compliant browsers just silently discard anything passed to the first next()
// It's still a bad idea to pass a value, as you're just creating silently failing
// code that's confussing. So always start a generator with an argument-free next()

// Thje first next() call (with nothing passed to it) is basically asking a
// question: "what next value does the *foo(..) generator have to give me?"
// Amd who amswers the question? The first yield "hello" expression.

// No mismatch here..
// Depending on who you think about asking the question, there is either a
// mismatch between the yield and next(..) calls, or not.
// But there's still an extra next()? compared to the number of yield statements,
// so that final it.next(7) call is again asking the question about what next
// value the generator will produce. But there's no more yield statements left
// to answer, is there? SO who who answers? The reutnr statement asnwers the question!

// And if there is no return in your generator -- return is certainly not any
// more required in generators than in regular functions - there's always an
// assumed/implicit return; (aka return undefined;) which serves the purpose
// of default answering the question posed byu the final it.next(7) call.

// these questions and answers - the two way message passing with yield and next()
// are quite powerful, but its not obvious at all how these mechanisms are connected
// to async flow control.. We are getting there..


// Multiple Iterators
// It may appear from the syntactic usage that when you use an iterator to control
// a generator, you're controlling the declared generation function itself.
// But there's a subtlety that easy to miss: each time you constructt an iterator,
// you are implicitly constructing an instance of the generator which that iterator
// will control.

// You can have multiple instances of the same generator running at the same time,
// and they can even interact:


function *foo() {
  var x = yield 2;
  z++;
  var y = yield(x * z)
  console.log(x,y,z);
}

var z = 1;
var it1 = foo();
var it2 = foo();

var val1 = it1.next().value; // 2 <-- yield 2
var val2 = it2.next().value; // 2 <-- yield 2

val1 = it1.next(val2 * 10).value; // 40 <-- x:20,  z:2
val2 = it2.next(val1 * 5).value; // 600 <-- x:200, z:3

it1.next(val2 / 2); // y: 300,  20 300 3
it2.next(val1 / 4); // y: 10,   200 10 3

// the most common usage of multiple instance of the same generator running concurrently
// is not such interactions, bbut when the generator is producing its own values without
// input, perhaps from some indepentently connected resourece.

// 1) Both instances of *foo() are started at the same time, and both next() calls
//revele a value of 2 from the yield 2 statements respectively.

// 2) val2 * 10 is 2 * 10, which is sent into the first generator instance it1,
// so that x gets value of 20. z is incremented from 1 to 2, and then 20* 2 is
// yielded out, setting val1 to 40.

// 3) val1 * 5 is 40 * 5, which is sent into the second generator instance it2, so that
// x gets value of 200. z is incremented again, from 2 to 3, and then 200 * 3 is yelded out,
// setting val2 to 600.

// 4) val2 / 2 is 600 / 2 which is sent into the the first generator instance it1,
// so that y gets value 300, then printing out 20 300 3 for its x y z values, respectively.

// 5) val1 / 4 is 40, which is sent into the second generator instance it2, so that y
// gets value 10, then printing out 200 10 3 for its x y z values, respectively.



// Interleaving
// Recall this scenario from the "run-to-completion" section:
var a = 1;
var b = 2;

function foo() {
  a++;
  b = b * a;
  a = b + 3;
}

function bar() {
  b--;
  a = 8 + b;
  b = a * 2;
}

// With normal js functions, of course either foo() can run completely first, or
// bar() can run completely first, but foo() cannot interleave its individual
// statements with bar(), so there are only two possible outcomes to the
// preceding program.

// However with generators, clearly interleaving (even in the middle of statements)
// is possibgle:

var a = 1;
var b = 2;


function *foo() {
  a++;
  yield;
  b = b * a;
  a = (yield b) + 3;
}

function *bar() {
  b--;
  yield;
  a = (yield 8) + b;
  b = a * (yield 2);
}

// depending on what respective order the iterators controlling *foo() and *bar()
// are called, the preceding program could produce several different results, in
// other words, we can actually illustrate (in a fake-ish way) the theoretical
// threaded race condidtions circumstances. By interleaving the two generator
// iterations over the same shared variables.
// First, lets make a helper called step(..) that controls an iterator.


function step(gen) {
  var it = gen();
  var last;

  return function() {
    // whatever yield'ed out, just send it right back in the next time
    last = it.next(last).value;
  };
}

// step(..) initializes  a generator to create its it iterator, then returns
// a function which when called, advances the iterator by one step.
// Additionally, the previously yielded out value is sent right back in at the
// next step. So yield 8 will just become  8 and yield b will just be b
// (whatever it was at the time of yield)

// Now, just for fun, let's experiment to see the effects of interleaving these
// different chunks of *foo() and *bar(), We'll start with the boring base case,
// making sure *foo() totally finishes before *bar()

a = 1;
b = 2;

var s1 = step(foo);
var s2 = step(bar);

// run *foo() completely first
s1();
s1();
s1();

// now run *bar()
s2();
s2();
s2();
s2();

console.log(a, b); // 11 22


 // The end result is 11 and 22, now let's mix up the interleaving ordering and
 // se how it changes the final values of a and b.

 // make sure to reset 'a' and 'b'
 var a = 1;
 var b = 2;

 var s1 = step(foo);
 var s2 = step(bar);

 s2(); // b--;
 s2(); // yield 8
 s1(); // a++
 s2(); // a = 8 + b
       // yield 2

s1()   // b = b * a;
       // yield b
s1()   // a = b + 3;
s2()   // b = a * 2;

console.log(a,b); // 12 18


// Producers and Iterators
// Imagine you're producing a series of values where each value has a definable
// relationship to the previous value. To do this, you're going to need a stateful
// producer that remembers the last value it gave out.

// You can implement something like that straightforwardly using a function closure

var gimmeSomething = (function() {
  var nextVal;

  return function() {
    if (nextVal === undefined) {
      nextVal = 1;
    }
    else {
      nextVal = (3 * nextVal) + 6;
    }
    return nextVal;
  }
})();

console.log(gimmeSomething()); // 1
console.log(gimmeSomething()); // 9
console.log(gimmeSomething()); // 33
console.log(gimmeSomething()); // 105


// generating an arbitary number series isn't a terrible realistic example.
// But what if you were generating records from a data source?
// You could imagine much the same code.

// In fact, this task is a very common design pattern, usually solved by iterators.
// An iterator is a well-defined interface for stepping through a series if values
// from a producer. The js interface for iterators, as it is in most languages, is
// to call next() each time you want the next value from the producer.

// we could implement the standard iterator interface for our number series producer:


var something = (function() {
  var nextVal;

  return {
    // needed for 'for..of' loops
    [Symbol.iterator]: function() { return this; },

    // standard iterator interface method
    next: function() {
      if (nextVal === undefined) {
        nextVal = 1;
      }
      else {
        nextVal = (3 * nextVal) + 6;
      }
      return { done:false, value:nextVal};
    }
  };
})();

console.log(something.next().value); // 1
console.log(something.next().value); // 9
console.log(something.next().value); // 33
console.log(something.next().value); // 105

// The next() call returns an object with two properties: done is a boolean
// value signaling the iterator's complete status, value holds the iteration value.

// ES6 also adds the for..of loop, which means that a standard iterator can
// automatically be consumed with a native loop syntax:

for (var v of something) {
  console.log(v);

  // don't let the loop run forever!
  if (v > 500) {
    break;
  }
}

//  THe for..of loop automatically calls next() for each iteration - it doesn't
// pass any values in to the next() - and it will automatically terminate
// on receiving a done:true. It's quite  handy for a looping over a set of data.

// Of course you could manually loop over iterators, calling next() and checking
// for the done:true condition to know when to stop:

for (
  var ret;
  ( ret = something.next()) && !ret.done;
) {
  console.log( ret.value );

    // don't let the loop run forever!
    if (ret.value > 500) {
      break;
    }
}

// 1 9 33 105 321 969

// The manuall for approach is certainly uglier than ES6 for ..of loop syntax
// but its advantage is that it affords you the opportunity to pass in values
// to the next(..) calls if necessary.

// In addition to making your own iterators, many built-in data structures in JS
// like arrays, also have default iterators:

var a = [1,3,5,7,9];

for (var v of a) {
  console.log(v);
} // 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

// The for ..of loop asks for its iterator, and automatically uses ut to iterate
// over a's values.


// Iterables
// THe something object in ouir running example is called an iterator, as it has
// the next() method on its interface. But a closely related term is "iterable",
//  which is an object that contains an iterator that can iterate over values.

// As of ES6 the way to retrieve an iterator from an iterable is that the iterable
// must have a function on it, with the name being the special ES6 symbol value
// Symbol.iterator. When this function is called, it returns an iterator. Though
// not required, generally each call should retrun a fresh new iterator.

// 'a' in theprevious snippet is an iterable. The for..of loop automatically calls
// its Symbol.iterator function to construct an iterator, but we could of course
// call the function manually, and use the iterator it returns:

var a = [1,3,5,7,9];

var it = a[Symbol.iterator]();

console.log(it.next().value); // 1
console.log(it.next().value); // 3
console.log(it.next().value); // 5

// in the precious code listing the defined something. you may have noticed
// this line:

[Symbol.iterator]: function() { return this; }

// That little bit of confusing code is making the something value - the interface
// of the something iterator - also an iterable; its now both and iterable and
// an iterator. Then we pass something to the for..of loop:

for (var v of something) {
  //..
}


// The for ..of loop expects something to be an iterable, so it looks for and calls
// its Symbol.iterator function. We defined that function to simply return this,
// so it just gives itself back, and the for ..of loop is none the wiser.

// Generator Iterator
// Lets turn the attention back to generators, in the context of iterators.
// A generator can be treated as a producer of values that we extract one at
// a time through an iterator interface's next() calls.

// So a gernator itself is not technically an iterable, though it's very similiar
// -- when you execute the generator, you get an iterator back.

function *foo() { }
var it = foo();
/*
// We can implement the something infinite number series producer from earlier
// with a gengerator, like this:

function *something() {
  var nextVal;

  while(true) {
    if (nextVal === undefined) {
      nextVal = 1
    }
    else {
      nextVal = (3 * nextVal) + 6;
    }
    yield nextVal;
  }
}

// Thats a bit cleaner.. Because the generator pauses at each yield, the state (scope)
// of the function *something() is kept around, meaning there's no need for the
// closure boilerplate to preserve variable state across calls..

// NOt only is it simpler code - we don't have to make our own iterator interface -
// it actually is more reasonable code, because it more clearly expresses the intent
// For example, the while true loop tells us the generator is intended to run forever -
// to keep generating values as long as we keep asking for them.

// and now we can use our shiny new *something() generator with a for..of loop:

for (var v of something()) {
  console.log(v);

  if (v > 500) {
    break;
  }
} // 1 9 33 105 321 969
// But we don't skip over for (var v of something()) . !  We didn't just reference
// something as a value like earlier examples, but instead called the *something()
// generator to get its iterator for the for..of loop to use.

// If you are paying close attention, two questions may arise from this interaction
// between the generator and the loop:

// Why couldn't we say for (var v of something) ..? Because something here is a
// generator, which is not an iterable. WE have to call something() to construct
// a producer for the for.oof loop to iterate over

// The something() call produces an iterator, but the for..of loop wants an iterable..
// The generator's iterator also has a Symbol.iterator function on it, which
// basically does a return this, just like something iterable we defined earlier.
// in other words, a generators iterator is also an iterable


// Stopping the Generator
// In the previous example, it would appear the iterator instance for *something()
// generator was basically left in a suspended state forever after the break in
// the loop was called. But there's a hidden behaviour that takes care of that for
// you. "Abnormal completion" (i.e, "early termination") of the for..of loop
//  -- gernally caused by break, return, or an uncaught exception sends a signal
// to the generators iterator for it to terminate.

// While a for.. of loop will automatically send this signal, you may wish to send
// the signal manually to an iterator, you do this by calling return(..)

// If you specify a try..finally clause isinde the generator, it will always
// be run wven when the generator is externally completed. THis is useful if
// you need to clean up resources (Datavbase connections etc):


function *something() {
  try {
      var nextVal;

      while(true) {
        if (nextVal === undefined) {
          nextVal = 1;
        }
        else {
          nextVal = (3 * nextVal) + 6;
        }
        yield nextVal;
      }
    }
    // cleanup clause
    finally {
      console.log("cleaning up");
    }
  }

  // The earlier example with break in the for.of loop will trigger the finally
  // clause. But you could instead manually terminate the generator's iterator
  // instance from the outside of with return(..):

  var it = something();
  for (var v of it) {
    console.log(v);

    if (v > 500) {
      // Complete the generator's iterator
      console.log(
        it.return("hello world").value
      );
    }
  }

// 1 9 33 105 321 969
// cleaning up
// Hello World

// When we call it.return(..) it immediately terminates the gernerator, which of
// course runs the finally clause. Also it  sets the returned value to whatever
// you passed in to the return(..), which is how "hello world" comes right back
// out. We also don't need to include break now because the generator's iterator
// is set to done:true, so the for..of loop will terminate on its next iteration.

// Generators own their namesake mostly to this consuming produced values use.
// But again, that's just one of the uses for for generators, and frankly not
// even the main one we're concerned with in the context of this book.

// But now that we more fully understand some of the mechanics of how they work,
// we can next turn attention to how generators apply to asynch concurrency.


// Iterating Generators Asynchronously
// What do generators have to do with asynch coding patterns, fixing problems
// with callbakc, and the like? Example:

function foo(x,y,cb) {
  $.ajax("data0.txt" + x + y + cb);
}

foo( 1, 2, function(err,text) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  else {
    console.log(text);
  }
});


// If we wanted to express this same task flow control with a generator we could do:

function foo(x,y) {
  $.ajax("data0.txt" + x + y,
  function(err,text) {
    if (err) {
      it.throw(err)
    }
    else {
      it.next(data);
    }
  }
);
}

function *main() {
  try {
    var next = yield foo("a","b")
  }
  catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}

var it = main();
// start it all up
it.next();


// Generators + PROMISES
// Recall the earlier Promise-based appreoach to our running ajax example:

function request(url) {
  $.ajax(url);
}

function foo(x,y) {
  return request("data0.txt")
}

foo(11, 31)
.then(
  function(text) {
    console.log(text);
  },
  function(err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
);


//In erarlier generator code for the running Ajax example, foo(..)
// returned nothing (undefined), and our itarator control code didn't
// care about the yielded value.

// But here the Promise-aware foo(..) returns a promise after making the ajax
// call. That suggests that we could construct a promise with foo(..) and
// then yield it from the generator, and then the iterator control code would
// recveive that promise.

// But what should iterator do with the promise?
// IT should listen for the promise to resolve (fullfillment or rejection)
// and then either resume the generator with the fulfillment message or
// throw an error into the generator with rejection reason.

// The natural way to get the most out of promises and generators is to yield
// a promise, and wire that promise to control the generator's iterator:

function request(url) {
  $.ajax(url)
}

function foo(x,y) {
  return request(
    "data0.txt"
  );
}

function *main() {
  try {
    var text = yield foo(11, 31);
    console.log(text);
  }
  catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}

// The most powerful revelation in this refactor is that the code inside
// *main() did not have to change at all. Inside the generator, whatever values
// are yielded out is just an opaque implementation detail, so we're not even
// aware it's happening,, nor do we need to worry about it.

// But how are we going to run *main() now? We still have some of the
// implementation plumbing work to do, to receive and wire up the yielded promise
// so that it resumes the generator upon resolution. We'll start by trying that
// manually:

var it = main();
var p =  it.next().value;

p.then(
  function(text) {
    it.next(text);
  },
  function(err) {
    it.throw(err);
  }
);

function run(gen) {
  var args = [].slize.call( arguments, 1), it;

// how would you use run(..) with *main() in our running  ajax example?
/*
function *main() {
  // ..
}
run(main)




// ES7 async and wait?
// The preceeding pattern-generators yielding promises that then control the
// generator's iterator to advance it to completion - is such a powerful and
// useful apprroach , it would be nicer if we could do it without the clutter
// of the library utility helper ( aka run(..) ):

function request(url) {
  $.ajax(url);
}

function foo(x,y) {
  return(
    request("data0.txt")
  )
}

async function main() {
  try {
    var text = await foo(11,31);
    console.log(text);
  }
  catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}
main();

// As you can see, there's no9 run(..) call (meaning no need for a lib util)
// to invoke and drive main(..) - it's just called as a normal function. Also
// main(..) isn't declared as a generator function anymore: it's a new kind
// of function: async function, And finally, instead of yielding a promise
// we await for it to resolve.

// The async function automatically knows what to do if you await a Promise -
// it will pause the funciton (just like with generators) until the promise
// resolves. We didn't illustrate it in this snippiet, but calling an async
// function like main() automatically returns a promise that's resolved whenever
// the function finishes completely.
// The async / await syntax look very familiar to c#, because it's basically
// identical.


// Promise COncurrency in Generators
// Imagine a scenario where you need to fetch data from two different sources,
// then combine those responses to make a third request, and finally print out
// the last response. Your first instict might be something like:

function request(url) {
  $.ajax(url);
}

function *foo() {
  var r1 = yield request("data0.txt");
  var r2 = yield request("data1.txt");

  var r3 = yield request(
    "data02.txt"
  );
  console.log(r3);
}
run(foo);


// The code will work, but in the specifics of our scenario, it's not optimal.
// Can you spot why?
// Because r1 and r2 requests can - and for performance reasons, should run
// concurrently, but in this code they will run sequentially; the "data01.txt"
// URL isn't ajax fetched until after the request is finished. These two requests
// are independent so the better performance approach would likely be to have
// them run at the same time.

// But how exactly  would you do that with a generator and yield? We Promise,
// specifically on their capability to manage state in a time-independent fashion.
// The simplest approach:

function *foo() {
  // make both requests "in parallel"
  var p1 = request("data0.txt");
  var p2 = request("data1.txt");

// wait until both promises resolve
  var r1 = yield p1;
  var r2 = yield p2;

  var r3 = yield request("data02.txt");
  console.log(r3);
}
run(foo);



// We could also express the flow control like this:

function *foo() {
  // make both requests in parallel and wait until both promises resolve

  var results = yield Promise.all([
    request("data0.txt"),
    request("data1.txt")
  ]);

  var r1 = results[0];
  var r2 = results[1];

  var r3 = yield request(
    "data2.txt"
  )
  console.log(r3);
}

run(foo);



// As a word of stylistic caution, be careful about how much Promise logic you
// include inside your generators. The whole point of using generators for
// asynchrony in the way we've described is to create simple, sequential sync-looking
// code, and to hide as much of the details of asynchrony away from that code
// as possible.

// For example, this might be a cleaner approach:

function bar(url1, url2) {
  return Promise.all([
    request("data0.txt"),
    request("data1.txt")
  ]);
}

function *foo() {
  // hide the promise-based concurrency details inside bar(..)
  var results = yield bar("data0.txt", "data1.txt");

  var r1 = results[0];
  var r2 = results[1];

  var r3 = yield request("data2.txt");

  console.log(r3);
}
run(foo);


// Hiding your promise logic inside a function that you merely call from your
// generator is especially useful if you are going to do a sophisticated series
// flow-control, for example:

function bar() {
  Promise.all([
    baz()
    .then()
    .Promise.race([])
  ])
  .then()
}




// Generator Concurrency
// As we discussed earlier two simultaneously running "processes" can
// cooperatively interleave their operations, and many times this can yield very
// powerful asynchrony expressions.

// Frankly our earlier examples of concurrency interleaving of multiple generators
// showed how to make it really confusing. But we hinted that there's places
// where this capability is quite useful.

// Recall a scenario where two different simultaneous ajax response handlers
// needed to coordinate with eachother to make sure that the data communication
// was not a race condition. We slotted the response int o the res array like this:

function request(url) {
  $.ajax(url);
}

function response(data) {
  if (data.url == "data0.txt") {
    res[0] = data;
  }
  else if ( data.url == "data1.txt") {
    res[1] = data;
  }
}

// but how can we use multiple generators concurrently for this scenario?
// Request(...) is a promise aware ajax utility

var res = [];

function *reqData(url) {
  res.push(
    yield request(url)
  );
}

// Instead of having to manually sort out res[0] and res[1] assignmentsl we'll
// use coordinated ordering so that res.push(..) properly slots the values in the
// expected and predictable order. The expressed logic thus should feel a bit cleaner.

// But how will we actually orchestrate this interaction? First lets just do it
// manually with promises:

var it1 = reqData("data0.txt");
var it2 = reqData("data1.txt");

var p1 = it1.next();
var p2 = it2.next();

p1.then( function(data) {
  it1.next(data);
  return p2;
})
.then( function(data) {
  it2.next(data);
});


// *reqData() two instances are both started to make their ajax requests, then
// paused with a yield. Then we choose to resume the first instance when p1 resolves,
// and then p2's resolution will start the second instance. In this way, we use Promise
// orchestration to ensure that res[0] will have the first response and res[1]
// will have the second response.

// But frankly this is awfully manual, and it doesn't really let the generators
// orchestrate themselves, which is where the true power can lie. Let's try
// a different way:

function request(url) {
  $.ajax(url);
}

var res = [];

function *reqData(url) {
  var data = yield request(url);

  yield;
  res.push(data);
}

var it1 = reqData("data0.txt");
var it2 = reqData("data1.txt");

var p1 = it1.next();
var p2 = it2.next();

p1.then( function(data) {
  iot1.next(data);
});

p2.then( function(data) {
  it2.next(data);
});

Promise.all([p1, p2])
  .then( function() {
    it1.next();
    it2.next();
  });


// OK this is a bit better but still manuall...
// Let's imagine using a utility called runAll(..)

var res = [];

runAll(
  function*() {
    var p1 = request("data0.txt")

    yield;

    res.push(yield p1);
  },
  function*() {
    var p2 = request("data1.txt");

    yield;

    res.push(yield p2);
  }
);





// Thunks
// So fare we've made the assumption that yielding a promise from a generator -
// and having that promise resume the generator via a helper utility like run(..)
// - was the best possible way to manage asynchrony with generators, so in the
// interest of completeness we'll take a brief look at it.

// Ingeneral computer science, there's an old pre-js concept called "thunk".
// A narrow expression of a thunk in js is a function that - without any parameters
// - is wired to call another function.

// In other words you wrap a function definition around function call- with any
// parameters it needs -- to defer the execution of that call, and that wrapping
// function is a thunk. When you later execute the thunk you end up calling the
// original funnction.
// For example:

function foo(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

function fooThunk() {
  return foo(3, 4);
}

console.log(fooThunk()); // 7

// So aynchronous thunk is pretty straightforward. But what about async thunk?
// Consider:

function foo(x, y, cb) {
  setTimeout( function() {
    cb( x + y);
  }, 1000);
}

function fooThunk(cb) {
  foo( 3, 4, cb);
}

// later
fooThunk( function(sum) {
  console.log(sum);
});

// As you can see fooThunk() expects only a cb(..) parameter as it already has
// values 3 and 4 prespecified and ready to pass to foo(..) A thunk is just
// wating around patiently for the last piece it needs to do it's job::callback
// You don't want to make thunks manually though, so let's invent a utility
// that does this wrapping for us. Consider:

function thunkify(fn) {
  var args = [].slize.call( arguments, 1);
  return function(cb) {
    args.push(cb);
    return fn.apply(null, args);
  };
}

var fooThunk = thunkify(3,4)
// The main difference hwere is the extra return function() {..} layer,
// here's how its usage differs:

var whatIsThis = thunkify(foo);
var fooThunk = whatIsThis(3,4);

// latger
fooThunk(function(sum) {
  console.log(sum);
});

// obviously, the big question this snippet implies is what is whatIsThis
// properly called?? It's not the thunk, it's the thing that will produce thunks
// from foo(..) calls. It's kind of like a factory for "thunks". There doesn't
// seem to be any kind of standard agreement for naming such a thing.

// So my proposal is "thunkory" ("thunk + "factory") So thunkify(..)
// produces a thunkory, and a thunkory produces thunks.



// Pre-ES6 Generators
// Manual Transformation
// Before we discuss the transpilers, let's derive how manual trapilation would
// work in the case of genreators. This is'nt just an academic exercise, because
// doing so will actually help further reinforce how they work. Consider:

function request(url) {
  $.ajax(url);
}
function *foo(url) {
  try {
    console.log("requesting:", url);
    var val = yield request(url);
    console.log(val);
  }
  catch(err) {
    console.log(err);
    return false;
  }
}

//var it = foo("data0.txt");

// The first thing to observe  is that we'll still need a normal foo()
// function that can be called, and it will still need to return an iterator.
// So, let's sketch out the non-generator tranformation.

function foo(url) {
  return {
    next: function(v) {
    },
    throw: function(e) {
      console.log(e);
    }
  };
}

var it = foo("data0.txt");
it.next();


// The next thing to observe is that a generator does its "magic" by suspending
// its scope/state, but we can emulate that with a function closure.
// To understand how to write such code, we'll first annotate diferent parts of
// our generator with state values:

function request(url) {
  $.ajax(url);
}

function *foo(url) {
  try {
    // STATE 1
    var TMP1 = request(url);

    // STATE 2
    var val = yield TMP1
    console.log(val);
  }
  catch(err) {
    // STATE 3
    console.log(err);
    return false;
  }
}

var a = foo("data0.txt");

// IN other words: 1 is the beginning state, 2 is the state if the request(...)
// succeeds, and 3 is the state of the request(..) fails.
// Going back to our transpiled generator, let's define a variable state in the
// closure we can use to keep track of the state:

function foo(url) {
  // manage generator state
  var state;
}

// Now lets define an inner function called process(..) inside the closure which
// handles each state, usinga switch statement:

function foo(url) {
  var state;

  function process(v) {
    switch(state) {
      case 1:
        console.log("requesting: ", url);
        return request(url)
      case 2:
        val = v;
        console.log(val);
        return;

      case 3:
      var err = v;
      console.log(err);
      return false;

    }
  }
}


// In state 1, instead of yield resolve(..) we did return resolve In terminal state 2
// there was ni explicit return, so we just do a return, which is the same as
// return undefined. In terminal state 3, there was a return false, so we preserve that.

// Now we need to define the code in the iterator functions so they call process(..)
// appropriately:

function request(url) {
  $.ajax(url);
}

function foo(url) {
  // manage generator state
  var state;

  function process(v) {
    switch(state) {
      case 1:
        console.log("requesting: ", url);
        return request(url)
      case 2:
        val = v;
        console.log(val);
        return;

      case 3:
      var err = v;
      console.log(err);
      return false;
    }
  }
  return {
    // make and return an iterator
    next: function(v) {
      if (!state) {
        state = 1;
        return {
          done: false,
          value: process()
        };
      }
      // yield resumed successfully
      else if (state == 1) {
        state = 2;
        return {
          done: true,
          value: process(v)
        };
      }
      // generator already completed
      else {
        return {
          done: true,
          value: undefined
        };
      }
    },
    "throw": function(e) {
      // the only explicit error handlig is in state 1
      if(state == 1) {
        state = 3;
        return {
          done: true,
          value: process(e)
        };
      }
      // otherwise an error wont be hanbdÃ¶es so just throw
      // it right back out
      else {
        throw e;
      }
    }
  };
}
var it = foo("data0.txt");
it.next()


// How does this code work?
// 1) the first call to iterator's next() call would move thge generator
// from the unitialized state to state 1, and the call process() to handle
// that state. The return value from request() which is the promise for the ajax
// response, is returned back as the value property from the next() call.

// 2) If the ajax request succeeds, the second call to next(..) should
// send in the ajax response value, which moves our state to 2. Proocess()
// is again called (this time with the passed in ajax response value) and the value
// property returned from next() will be undefined.

// 3) However, if the ajax request fails throw(..) should be called with the error,
// which would move the state from 1  to 3, (insead of 2). Again process() is
// called, this time with the error value. The case returns false, which is set as
// the value property returned from the throw(..) call.

// From the outside - that is interating only with the iterator - this fo(..)
// normal function works pretty much the same  as the *foo(..) generator would
// have worked. So we've effectively transpiled our ES6 generator to pre-ES6
// compabillity.

// We could then manually instantiate our generator and control its iterator -
// calling var it = foo(..) and it.next(..) and such-or better, we could pass it to
// our previously defined run(..) utility and run(foo, "..")


// Automatic Tranpilation
// The preceeding exercise of manually deriving a transformation of our ES6
// generator to pre-ES6 equivalent teaches ushow generators work conceptually.
// But thtattransformation was really intricate and non-portable to other
// generators in our code. It would be quite impractical to do this work by hand,
// and would completely obviate all the benefit of generators.
// But luckelu,several  tools alrady exist that can automatically convert ES6
// generators to thingslike what derived in the previous section. Not only do they
// do the heavy lifting work for us, but they also handle several complications
// that we glossed over.

// One such tool is a regenaotr from the smart folks of facebook.

// If se use regenerator to transpile our previous gernerator, here's the code
// produced (at the time of writing):

var foo = regeneratorRuntime.mark(function foo(url) {
  var val;
  return regeneratorRuntime.wrap(function foo$(context$1$0.next) {
    while (1) switch (context$1$0.prev = context$1$0.next) {
       case 0:
          context$1$0.prev = 0;
          console.log("requesting: ", url);
          context$1$0.next = 4;
          return request (url);
       case 4:
          val = context$1$0.sent;
          console.log(val);
          context$1$0.next = 12;
          break;
      case 12:
      case "end":
          return context$1$0.stop();
    }
  },foo this, [[0, 8]];)
});



// Transpiling
// Made even worse by the rapid evolution of features, a problem arises for
// js developers who at once may both strongly desire to use new features
// while at the same time beingh slapped with the reality that their site/apps
// may need to support older browsers withoout such support.

// The way ES5 appears to have played out in broader industry, thye typical
// mindset was that code bases waited to adopt ES5 until most if not all pre-
// ES5 enviroments had fallout out of their support spectrum. As a result, many
// aare just recvently (at the time of writing) starting to adopt things
// like strict mode, which  landed in ES5 over five years ago.
// It's widely concidered to be a harmful approach for the future of js ecosystem
// to wait and trail the specification by so many years. All those responsible
// for evoling the language desire for developers to begin basing their code on
// the new features and patterns as soon as they stabilize in specification form
// and browsers have a chance to implement them.

// So how do we resolve this seeming contradict ion= The answer is tooling,
// specifically a technique called "transpiling" (transofmration + compiling)
// Rougly, the idea is to use a special tool to transform your ES6 codeinto
// equivalent (or close) matches that work in ES5 enviroments.

// For example, concider shorthand proerty definitions. Here is ES6 form:

var foo = [1,2,3]

var obj = {
  foo
};

// But here's how that transpiles:

var foo = [1,2,3]

var obj = {
  foo: foo
};

console.log(obj.foo); // [1, 2, 3]

// This is a minior but pleasant transofmration that lets us shortenb the foo: foo
// in an object literal declaration to just foo, if the names are the same.

// Transpilers perform these transformations for you,  usually in a build workflow
// step similiar to how you perform linting, minification and other similiar operations.

// Shims/Polyfill
// Not all new features need a transpiler. Polyfills (aka shims) are a pattern
// for defining equivalent behaviour from a newer enviroment into an older enviroment,
// when possible. Syntax cannot be polyfilled, but APIs often can be.

// For example, Object.is(..) is a new utility for checking strict equality
// of two values, but without the nuanced exeptions that === has for NaN and -0 Values.
// The polyfill for Object.is(..) is pretty easy:

if (!Object.is) {
  Object.is = function(v1,v2) {
    // test for -0
    if (v1 === 0 && v2 === 0) {
      return 1 / v1 === 1 / v2;
    }
    // test for NaN
    if (v1 !== v1) {
      return v2 !== v2;
    }
    // everything else
    return v1 === v2;
  };
}



// Syntax
// Block-Scoped Declarations
// You're probably aware that the fundamental unit of variable scoping in javascript
// has always been the function. If you needed to create a block of scope, the
// most prevalent way to do so other than a regular function declaration was the
// immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) For example:

var a = 2;

(function IIFE() {
  var a = 3;
  console.log(a); // 3
})()
console.log(a); // 2


// Let declarations
// Howeever, we can now create delcarations that are bound to any block, called
// "block scoping". This means all we need is a pair of {}  to create a scope.
// Instead of using var, which always declare variables attached to the ecnclosing
// function (or global if top level) scope use let:

var a = 2;
{
  let a = 3;
  console.log(a); // 3
}
console.log(a); // 2


// It's not very uncommong or idiomatic thus far in JS to use a standalong {..}
// block, but it's always been valid. And developers from other languages that
// have block scoping will readily recognize that pattern.

// I believe the best way to create block-scoped variables, with a dedicated {..}
// block. Moreoever you should always put the let declaration(s) at the very top
// of that block. If you haver more than one to declare, I'd recommend using just
// one let.

// Stylistically, i even prefer to put the let on the same line as  the opening {
// to make it clrearer that this block is only for the purpose of declaring the scope
// for those variables.

{ let a = 2,b,c
  // ..
}
// Now that's going to look strange and it's not likely going to match  the
// recommendations given in most ES6 litterature. But I have reasons for my madness.


// There's another experimental (not standardized) form of delcaration called the
// let-block, which looks like:

let (a = 2, b, c) {
  // ..
}

  // That form is what i call explicit block scoping, whereas the let.. declaration
  // form trhat mirros var is more implicit, as it kind of hijacks whateve {..}
  // pair its found in. Generally developers find explicit mechanisms a bit more
  // preferable than implicit mechanisms, and i claim this is one of those cases.

  // If you compare the previous two snippet forms, they're very similiar and in
  // my opinion both qualify stylistically as explicit block scoping.
  // unfortunately the let(..) {..} form, the most explicit of the options, was
  // not adopted in ES6. That may be revisited post.ES6, but for now the former
  // option is our best, i think.

  // To reinforce the implicit nature of let .. declarations, consider these usages:

  let a = 2;

  if (a > 1) {
    let b = a * 3;
    console.log(b);

    for (let i = a; i <= b; i++) {
      let j = i + 10;
      console.log(j);
    } // 12, 13, 14, 15, 16

    let c = a + b;
    console.log(c); // 8
  }

// Quick quiz without looking back at that snippet: Which variable(s) exist only
// inside the if statement, and which variable(s) exist only inside the for loop?

// The answers: the if statement contains b and c block scoped variables, and the
// for loop contains i and j blocked-scoped variables.

// Did you have to think about if for a moment?  Does it surprise you that i isn't
// added to the ecnclosing if statement scope?  That mental pause and questioning
// I call it a "mental tax" -comes from the fact that this let mechanism is not only new
// to us, but it's also implicit.

// There's also a hazard in the let c = .. declaration appearing so far down in
// the scope. Unlike traditional var-declared variables, which are attached to the
// entire enclosing function scope regardless of where they appear, let declarations
// attach to the block scope but are not initlialized  until they appear in the block.

// Accessing a let-declared variable earlier than its let .. delcarttion/initialization
// causes an error, whereas with var declarations the ordering doesn't matter (except
// stylistically) Consider:

{
  console.log(a); // undefined
  console.log(b); // Reference Error!

  var a;
  let b;
}

 // This referenceError from accessing to-early let-declared references is tecnhically
 // called a "Temporal Dead Zone TDZ" error - your accessing a variable that's
 // been declared but not yet initialized. This will not be the only time we see TDZ
 // errors, they crop up in several places in ES6. Also note that "initialized"
 // doesn't require explicitly assigning a value in your code, as let b; is totally
 // valid. A variable that's not gioven an assignment at declaration time is assumed
 // to have been assigned the undefined value, so let b; is the same as let b = undefined;
 // explicit assignment or not, you cannot access b until the let b statement is run.

 // One last gotcha: typeof behaves differently with TDZ variables: Example:

 {
   // 'a' is not declared
   if (typeof a === "undefined") {
     console.log("foo");
   }
   if (typeof b === "undefined") {
     console.log(b); // refernce error
     //..
   }
   let b;
 }



 // The a is not  declared, so typeof is the only safe way to check for its existance
 // or not. But typeof b throws the TDZ error because further down in the code there
 // happens to be a let b declaration..

 // Not it should be clearer why I insist that the let declarations should be at the
 // top of their scope. That totally aavoids the accidental errors of accessing
 // too early. It also makes it more xplicit when you look at the start of a block,
 // any block, what variables it contains.

 // Your blocks (if statements, while loops etc) don't have to share their original
 // behaviour with scoping behaviour.

 // This explicitness on your part, which is up to you to maintain with dicipline,
 // will save you lots of refactor headaches and footguns down the line.
*/

 // let + for
 // The only exception I'd make to the preference for the explicit form of let
 // declaration blocking is a let that appears in the header of for loop. The
 // reason may seem nuanced, but i belive it to be one of the more important ES6
 // features. Consider:

 var funcs = [];

 for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
   funcs.push( function() {
     console.log( i );
   });
 }

funcs[3](); // 3

// The let i in the for header declares an i not just for the for loop itself, but
// it redeclares a new i for each iteration of the loop. That means that closures
// created inside the loop tieration close over those per-iteration variables the
// way you'd expect.

// If you tried that same snippet but with var i in the for loop header, you'd get
// 5  insteaad of 3, because there'd only be one i in the outer scope that was closed
// over, instead of a new i for each iteration's function to close over.
// You could also have accomplished the same thing slightly more verbosely:

var funcs = [];

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  let j = i;
  funcs.push( function() {
    console.log(j);
  });
}
funcs[3](); // 3
